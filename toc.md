Some Concepts of Work in the History of Western Thought

__________

"Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it
all the days of your life. It will produce thorns and thistles for you,
and you will eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your brow
you will eat your food until you return to the ground..." -- Genesis 3
