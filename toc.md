# By the Sweat of Your Brow

Philosophical Perspectives on Work

__________

"Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it
all the days of your life. It will produce thorns and thistles for you,
and you will eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your brow
you will eat your food until you return to the ground..." -- Genesis 3

"The race of men that the immortals who dwell on Olympus made first of all was
of gold... They lived like gods, with carefree heart, remote from toil and
misery." -- Hesiod, *Works and Days*

"The citizen must not live the life of mechanics or shopkeepers, which is
ignoble and inimical to goodness. Nor can those who are to be citizens engage
in farming: leisure is a necessity, both for growth in goodness, and for the
pursuit of political activities." — Aristotle, *Politics*

"we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden
to any of you." -- Paul, Second Letter to the Thessalonians

"Every man is, or hopes to be, and idler.” — Samuel Johnson, *The Idler*

"I had only one faith, one source of strength: work... Work! Consider, gentlemen:
work forms the only law of the world. Life has no other purpose, there is no
other reason for existence, we all come into being only in order to do our
share of the work, and then vanish." -- Émile Zola

"The labor process is the everlasting nature-imposed condition of human
existence." — Karl Marx, *Capital*

"The truth seems to be that, as human nature is constituted, man rapidly
degenerates unless he has some hard work to do, some difficulties to overcome,
and that strenuous exertion is necessary for physical and moral health." --
Alfred Marshall, *Principles of Economics*


"The natural thing to do is to work — to recognize that prosperity and
happiness can be obtained only through honest effort." -- Henry Ford, *My Life
and Work*

"Earning a wage is a prison occupation / 
And a wage-earner is a sort of gaol-bird" -- D.H. Lawrence, *Wages*

"This is very important -- to take leisure time. Pace is the essence. Without
stopping entirely and doing nothing at all for great periods, you're gonna lose
everything... just to do nothing at all, very, very important. And how many
people do this in modern society? Very few. That's why they're all totally mad,
frustrated, angry and hateful." -- Charles Bukowski
