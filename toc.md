A history of the idea of work.

__________

"I had only one faith, one source of strength: workâ€¦ Work! Consider, gentlemen:
work forms the only law of the world. Life has no other purpose, there is no
other reason for existence, we all come into being only in order to do our
share of the work, and then vanish." -- Emile Zola

"This is very important -- to take leisure time. Pace is the essence. Without
stopping entirely and doing nothing at all for great periods, you're gonna lose
everything...just to do nothing at all, very, very important. And how many
people do this in modern society? Very few. That's why they're all totally mad,
frustrated, angry and hateful." -- Charles Bukowski

"When he ought to have been working, instead he was 'contemplating the idea of
work!'" -- The author's wife
