"The value we set on work and on leisure is very far from being the same as that of the Greek in Roman world, or of the Middle Ages… So very different that the men of the past would have been incapable of understanding the modern conception of work, just as we are unable to understand their notion of leisure simply and directly, without an effort of thought." — Leisure, p. 22
