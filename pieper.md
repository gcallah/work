"The value we set on work and on leisure is very far from being the same as
that of the Greek in Roman world, or of the Middle Ages… So very different that
the men of the past would have been incapable of understanding the modern
conception of work, just as we are unable to understand their notion of leisure
simply and directly, without an effort of thought." — Leisure, p. 22


"In its extreme for the passion for work, naturally blind to every form of
divine worship and often inimical to it, turns abruptly into its contrary, and
work becomes a cult, becomes a religion. To work means to pray, Carlyle wrote,
and he went on to say that fundamentally all genuine work is religion, and any
religion that is not work ought to be left to Brahmins and dancing dervishes."
-- Leisure, p. 69
