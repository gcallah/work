# By the Sweat of Your Brow

A history of the idea of work.

__________

Although this is not the usual procedure, I would like to begin this proposal
by offering a few quotes relating to work and leisure from across the
centuries:

"Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it
all the days of your life. It will produce thorns and thistles for you,
and you will eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your brow
you will eat your food until you return to the ground..." -- Genesis 3

"we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden
to any of you." -- Paul, Second Letter to the Thessalonians

"I had only one faith, one source of strength: work... Work! Consider, gentlemen:
work forms the only law of the world. Life has no other purpose, there is no
other reason for existence, we all come into being only in order to do our
share of the work, and then vanish." -- Emile Zola

"This is very important -- to take leisure time. Pace is the essence. Without
stopping entirely and doing nothing at all for great periods, you're gonna lose
everything... just to do nothing at all, very, very important. And how many
people do this in modern society? Very few. That's why they're all totally mad,
frustrated, angry and hateful." -- Charles Bukowski

As exhibited in the above quotes,
Western civlization exhibits a near schizophrenic condition in its
attitude towards laboring. Is work is a curse, or is work the very purpose of life!
Should we be proud of how hard we have worked... or should we be ashamed we
have not had more leisure?

My attention was first drawn to the possibility of an historical study of
how this situation developed by the work of Karl LÃ¶with, in particular his
section on "The Problem of Work" in his book, *From Hegel to Nietzsche*. While I
found the section fascinating, at the same time, I realized that it only
covered about 80 years, and for the most part 
dealt with thinkers from a single country (Germany).
