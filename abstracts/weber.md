# Max Weber on Work

Gülşen Seven

Max Weber was not a scholar of work. His preoccupation with *Beruf*, the German
word that Weber uses for work and labour, is derivative of his wider interest
in characterizing the nature of Western modernity. As such, Beruf is one of the
critical notions that inform his understanding of modernity in terms of
increasing rationalization - understood as a unique form of social action based
on reason - of all spheres of life: economic, social, political and cultural.
While Weber celebrates the ascendancy of modern, economic-technical rationality
in different aspects of life its propensity to stimulate
productivity, efficiency and efficacy, it is also to be watched warily for its
proclivity to strip our very existence of meaning by turning all human action
into routine, repetitive, soulless activity. It is in this context that Weber’s
choice of *Beruf*, which he uses to mean both profession and calling, to
designate work acquires significance: labour/work, in modernity, for Weber is
not simply a purely utilitarian, mundane engagement, it is also what could, at
least potentially, supply our everyday existence with a transcendental meaning.
This chapter is concerned with portraying this ambiguity or the doubleness of
*Beruf* in Weber’s works, particularly in *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of
Capitalism* and *The Vocation Lectures*, and evaluate its significance for our
contemporary understanding of work.
