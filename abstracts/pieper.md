# Leisure and Work in Josef Pieper’s Philosophy of Human Nature and Culture

This chapter takes Pieper’s concept of leisure (*Musse*) as a response to the
work-ethic of Max Weber. While Weber tried to rely on the Protestant idea of
the virtue of diligence and perseverance, in accordance with the Protestant
teachings of social life, Pieper, as a Catholic theorist, goes back to medieval
Christian notions of contemplation. Of course, this idea was closely connected
to ancient ideas of what was called the contemplative way of life, as opposed
to the vita activa. Pieper is able to show that this concept is surviving in
the Christian context, and in fact it is enriched by the Christian teaching.
Medieval christianity showed that the human being can achieve much more than
simply work to provide for existential needs. According to the Christian
teaching, as understood by Aquinas and others, we can reach a higher realm of
our life if we are able to withdraw (*Arbeitspause*) for some time from the world
of work (*Arbeitswelt*), and allow our spirit and mind (*Geist*) to work (*arbeit*),
instead of our hands and body. 

Beside this internal Christian debate with a Protestant idea of work-ethic,
Pieper also intends to show us that the modern ideologies of work (both of the
left- and of the right-wing Totalitarian regimes) in fact lead to a simplified
form of existence, that he calls "*Entproletarisierung*". In this respect he
seems to agree with Ortega's criticism of the revolt of the masses. Finally,
the chapter looks at the positive content of leisure, including an analysis of
the ideas of play (*Spiel*) and culture (*Kult*).
