# Work in the New Natural Law Theory

[Christopher Tollefsen](../bios/tollefsen.md), University of South Carolina
 
 
The New Natural Law (NNL) theory grounds practical deliberation in principles
directing rational agents towards the pursuit of goods that are intrinsic
dimensions of human flourishing, individually and in community.  Work has
consistently been identified as one such good, as an integral and constitutive
aspect of human well-being worth engaging in for its own sake.  Initially, NNL
theorists distinguished the goods of work and play, but they have more recently
sought to identify the core of the good of work in such a way as also to
encompass the good of play, as "excellence in activity engaged in for its own
sake."  This paper investigates a number of questions addressed or raised by
the NNL approach: what differentiates work from play? Whence come the standards
of excellence that are essential to the goods of work and play? And what
ethical norms should govern human engagement in work and play? Finally, the
paper will take up the question of work from a theistic standpoint: in what way
are human and divine work related, both in this life, and in relation to the
Kingdom of Heaven?
