# Adam Smith and the Division of Labor

[Maria Pia Paganelli](../bios/paganelli.md)

For Adam Smith labor is the source of wealth, the measure of wealth, and the reason for wealth.

People need to be free to receive the fruits of their labor not only because
it is their right but also because that will give them incentives to produce more
and innovate more. Increased production and innovation will generate the
prosperity that brings people out of absolute poverty. They create the means to
support a growing population, and a cheerful society.
