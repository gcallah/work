# Mises: The Disutility of Labor

Gabriel Frank Benzecry, Middle Tennessee State University

Human action is a purposeful behavior conducted by humans to increase their
utility. In praxeology (the science of human action), it is uncommon, if not
impossible, for humans to engage in behaviors that lead to a loss of utility.
However, if we look at a laborious job, people are engaging in an activity that
is seen as unpleasant and uncomfortable by the actors. Humans suffer the
negative utility of work to benefit from the positive value of leisure. Ludwig
Von Mises recognized this conflicting relationship between labor and leisure
and endeavored to illuminate what seems to be a significant conundrum. Mises
observed that when people work, they seem to participate in a process that does
not provide positive value; on the contrary, work is frequently uncomfortable
for individuals and often ends up reducing their utility. Many employees do not
like their jobs but rather see them as a means to an end. As a result, the act
of working by itself, according to Mises, is an activity that causes
disutility. The goal of this chapter is to traverse what Mises referred to as
the "disutility of labor."
