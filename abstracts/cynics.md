# 'Take This Job and Shove It':  The Greek Cynics on Work and Wealth

Kenneth B. McIntyre

Most educated people are aware that the classical Greek understanding of the
importance or significance of work and wealth differs considerably from modern
conceptions.  However, within the Greek world, there was a group of thinkers
known to us as the Cynics who held views about work and wealth that were
considered extraordinarily eccentric among the Greeks themselves.  The Cynics
rejected both the importance of work and wealth, and substituted for such
activities the praise of naturalism and poverty.  In my essay, I explore the
legend of the Cynicsâ€™ understanding of work and wealth, and consider the
meaning of their rejection of conventional life.
