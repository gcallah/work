# Kierkegaard on the Laborer

[Nathanael Blake](bios/blake.md)

The most straight-forward answer to the question of what Kierkegaard thought
about labor is that he didn't. Though he worked hard on his writings, he lived
off of his inheritance. His writings do not contain a systematic theory of
labor or economics, and attempting to piece one together from various passages
in his work is complicated by the polyphonous nature of his authorship. 

Kierkegaard's contributions on the subject are not about labor itself, but
about the person who labors, and on this he adds much to the discussion. The
concepts and concerns he articulated in a Christian framework retain their
importance today. As business boast of their values and corporate powers cover
themselves in the language of family, community and purpose, we can analyze and
critique them using the work of Kierkegaard, who is a fierce critic of wealth
and privilege posing as disinterested goodness.
At the same time, as
many of successful people genuinely seek meaning in their work, we can learn from
Kierkegaard, the subtle analyst of man's inward self and its relations to both
the external and the eternal.
