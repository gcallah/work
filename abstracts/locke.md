# John Locke:  Ownership from Labor

Jason Ferrell

John Locke’s discussion of labor in *Two Treatises of Government* has been one of
the most analyzed pieces of writing since it first appeared, to the point that
it is regarded as the standard justification of property within the liberal
tradition.  Regardless of whether one approves or disapproves of his view, the
familiarity of what he says has led to a loss of appreciation regarding just
how novel, and controversial, his argument actually is.  In this chapter I will
attempt to reconstruct not only Locke’s argument, but the historical context
within which he wrote, to highlight how radical his view was.  Then I will
recount the reception of his work by later scholars, to clarify what his
contribution to political and economic thought has been.  My goal will be to
specify what is – and what remains – innovative about Locke’s discussion, so as
to capture the distinctive traits of an argument that continue to warrant our
attention.
