# The Woman’s Soul as "Shelter": Edith Stein on the Work of Women

[Sarah Jane Wilford](bios/wilford.md)

Though sometimes overlooked, the distinct category of the work of women is
essential to a thorough intellectual history of the idea of work. In the vein
of Jean Bethke Elshtain’s seminal work *Public Man, Private Woman*, which
surfaced the behind-the scenes work of women as relevant to the history of
western political philosophy, this chapter hopes to highlight the oftentimes
minimised or neglected types of work, historically considered to belong the
realm of women or the "private sphere", as relevant to the history of the idea
of work. To do so, this chapter explores the writings of philosopher and saint
Edith Stein. Mentored by Edmund Husserl and martyred in Auschwitz, Edith Stein
was one of the most interesting thinkers of the twentieth century. First,
Stein’s writings on the work of women and women’s particular "vocations" are
interrogated, offering an overview of one important perspective on the feminine
experience of work and work historically labelled as feminine. This includes
work in the areas of care, spirituality, and education. Second, this chapter
establishes links between Stein on the theme of women’s work and one of her
other major intellectual interests – the phenomenology of empathy
