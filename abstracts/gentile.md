# Giovanni Gentile and the "Humanism of Labor"

[Spartaco Pupo](../bios/pupo.md)

Giovanni Gentile (1875-1944), considered by some to be the most influential
Italian philosopher of the twentieth century as well as the leading exponent of
Italian idealism, matured his convictions about the critical role that labor
would have to play in the economy of the twentieth century in the years
immediately following World War I. This vision was carried forward with
coherence throughout his intellectual production, and it is organically
fulfilled in his work-testament, *Genesis and Structure of Society* (published
posthumously in 1946). Gentile conceived the modern world as having realized
the spiritual significance of labor, just as he recognized the spiritual
significance of culture. He saw a methodological and critical value in the
"sense" of manual and intellectual activity, in its inextricable relationship
to the "Absolute Spirit" which allows one to comprehend the formative value of
working action. Gentile's doctrine of "humanism of labor" affirms the
importance of the encounter between "workers" and "intellectuals" in the
context of human values, discovering a fusion of labor and culture.
