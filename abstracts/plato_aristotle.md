# Plato and Aristotle on Work

James B. Murphy

Plato and Aristotle both express contempt for manual labor and for all
commercial activities: the first debases the body and the second debases the
mind. Plato expressly forbids citizens from participating in gainful employment
whereas Aristotle only discourages citizens from such activity. For Greek
aristocratic culture, leisure (*schole*) was the norm while work was the absence
of leisure (*ascholia*); by contrast in our society, work is the norm and "free
time" is the absence of work. For the Greeks, work is a necessary evil for the
sake of leisure; for our culture, by contrast, leisure is dominated by the
habits forged in work: hence, we "work out" at the gym, "work" on our
basketball game, and even "work" on our marriages. For Plato and Aristotle only
freely chosen activities pursued for their own sake lead us to happiness.
Aristotle concedes that if manual labor were approached in a spirit of the love
of skill and learning, it could become an activity worthy of a freeman. Winston
Churchill, after all, was a unionized bricklayer. The challenge Plato and
Aristotle pose to us is how to structure ordinary work so that it offers
opportunities for liberal learning: that is, how to educate people to become
"reflective practitioners."
