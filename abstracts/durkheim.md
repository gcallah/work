# Durkheim on Anomie

J. McKenzie Alexander

Ã‰mile Durkheim, who along with Max Weber is considered one of the founders of
sociology, developed the concept of *anomie*. With the increasing
industrialization of Europe and the rise of a large class of industrial workers
performing mechanical tasks, and lacking meaningful connections to others that
were formerly provided by guilds, churches, and village life, many individuals
suffered from *anomie*, where the individual
is left to act from pure self-interest. Such individuals, left bereft of connection to
things larger than themselves, were likely to engage in anti-social activity,
or, at the extreme, commit suicide (the title of one of his major works),
either because they find life purposeless, or because their unchecked desires
can never by fulfilled.
