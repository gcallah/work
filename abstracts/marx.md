Marx's Theory of Work

[Jonathan Askonas](../bios/askonas.md)

There is no philosopher for whom a theory of work is more central than for
Marx, and no philosopher whose unique contributions are more misunderstood. In
this chapter, I will argue that much of what lies on the surface of Marx's
theory of labor is simply a straightforward and orthodox interpretation of
Aristotle and of British political economy. What is new and radical in Marx's
theory of labor is its projection of Aristotelian economics into History, its
discovery of the problem of technology, and its implicit reliance on
eschatological thinking. Returning to a critical examination of Marx's
historical and materialist theory of labor yields re-invigorating insights into
the problem confronting humanity when its unique status as *homo faber* is called
into question by the dawn of machine intelligence and powerful robotics.
