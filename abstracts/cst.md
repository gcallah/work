# Work in Catholic Social Teaching

[Gene Callahan](../bios/callahan.md), New York University

What is today known as Catholic social teaching, while having ancient roots,
began to clearly emerge first in Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical letter *Rerum
novarum*. It was elaborated and expanded upon by the writings of the first
"distributists," G.K. Chesterton and Hilarire Belloc, and took practical form
in the establishment of the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation in Spain, in
Dorothy Day's Catholic Worker Movement, and in the Christian democracy movement.

Catholic social teaching holds that work is a key component of a flourishing
human life, but only so long as the worker is treated with dignity, receives
fair pay, and has the right to organize in order to change unsatisfactory
working conditions. As such, it offers an important "third way" between
capitalism and socialism.
