# Hegel on Work's Two-Sidedness

[William Lombardo](../bios/lombardo.md)

Hegel’s thought on work is too often obscured by Marx’s influential critique.
Work is central to Hegel’s accounts both of selfhood and of the intersubjective
recognition enabled by market-based civil society and by political
representation. This essay seeks to harmonize the discussions of work in the
*Phenomenology of Spirit* with those in the *Philosophy of Right*, devoting special
attention to Hegel’s transformation of early modern political economists, to
capture work’s essential two-sidedness: its ability to both liberate and
enslave, and its simultaneously public and private character. This requires
drawing a distinction between Hegel’s accounts of labor as such—that is, of
labor as a universal condition of humankind—and of its historical
determinations. For all individuals, work is constitutive of the self-conscious
subject and not merely appended to a fully-formed individual. Work develops in
history, however, and reaches its highest *social* expression in modernity.
