# Luther on Vocation

[Orsolya Horváth](../bios/horvath.md)

I will approach Luther’s thinking on work and vocation from two different
directions. The first is Luther’s Christ-centered ontology, which, albeit never
fleshed out by him methodically, is a permanent framework in his writings. This
ontology has the embodied God, the reality of Jesus Christ, as its focal point,
which in turn explains Luther’s fondness of thinking in paradoxes. As in the
figure of Jesus Christ the deprecated is praised, the humble is exalted, the
slave is lord, so reality saturated with Jesus Christ is defined by the laws of
the paradoxical.

The other direction to approach Luther’s way of thinking is his teaching on the
priesthood of all believers (also referred to as universal priesthood), which
enhances the appreciation of everyday human life and its ordinary activities.
Equality before God results in personal responsibility, which leads to a new
picture of human community and society.
