# Thomas Aquinas on work

[Tamás Nyirkos](../bios/nyirkos.md)

When discussing Thomas Aquinas' views on work, one must distinguish two meanings of the word. In
a more general sense, "work as activity" (in contrast to idleness) is treated by Aquinas as a virtuous
undertaking that realizes the potential of the human creature as the image and likeness of God. Even
if human beings – who are composed of potentiality and actuality – can never become exactly like
God who is pure actuality (actus purus), it is to the extent they participate in God's good works that
they approach the divine. Work as activity is thus a necessary requirement to transcend mere
potentiality which is unworthy of the human condition. At the same time, in a more restricted sense,
"work as manual labor" is not an unconditional precept but should be considered by its goals:
whether it maintains physical existence, helps to avoid evil, curbs concupiscence, or contributes to
almsgiving. The gradual development of Aquinas' argument nevertheless indicates that not even
manual labor is without spiritual and social relevance, which is even more true of work as a "human
occupation whereby the human being can lawfully gain a livelihood, whether by using his hands, his
feet, or his tongue." In other words, the analysis of manual labor leads back to the more overarching
issue of work as human action, giving the concept of "work" a definition that remains embedded in a
theological framework and impossible to understand without it.
