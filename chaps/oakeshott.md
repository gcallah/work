In this titular poetic Oakeshottian phrase is contained a view of human
life which does not prioritize practical existence (including labor),
but rather employs poetic imagining and philosophical exploration as
ways of superseding it without negating it ("the splendors of the
firmament of time may be eclipsed but are extinguished not"). This essay
explores the relevance of Oakeshott's arresting phrase, "the deadliness
of doing,"^1^ to the theme of this edited volume on the place of labor
in a human life. The steps in this exploration include:

**[Practical Activity]{.underline}**

In Oakeshott's rather Daoist^2^ take on reality, human activity consists
of being active in various ways, in which a fluid relationship between
self and non-self defines and divulges itself. In practical activity the
images are those of desire and aversion, approval and disapproval, and
have a utilitarian definition of "fact" and "non-fact." Practical
activity for Oakeshott is the most common way of creating mental images,
and although it does not constitute the totality of human experience, it
is "unavoidable." Other ways of being active for Oakeshott are the
scientific, historical, poetic, and philosophic.^3^

For our purposes here, it is not required to delve into Oakeshott's
various modes of experience. What is important in this instance is that
for Oakeshott there are important forms of "non-laborious" activity,
which have evolved over time and which offer us different avenues to
what is satisfactory in experience. These are not primarily concerned
with desire, aversion and utility, and the most important of these for
our purposes is poetic imagining, which offers an escape from the
"deadliness of doing" in unavoidable practical activity, and as well
from the quantitive language of modern science which (along with
practice) has come to dominate the civilized conversation of the
species.

For Oakeshott poetic (or aesthetic) imagining is the most realistic
escape from the deadening voices of practice and modern science largely
because, on Oakeshott's view, it involves the creation of unique images
for their own creative sake, distinguished from the practical symbolism
of contemporary quotidian languages. Oakeshott even asserts that poetic
images are all that can remain of Plato's forms, which were a matter of
copying putatively pre-existing models in intellective space, not the
creation of unique images with no meaning outside themselves. For
Oakeshott, for example, what may have been crafted a millenium ago as a
practical, religious symbolic image of worship, could for contemporary
viewers become simply an image of contemplative delight. Nor need such
images be bounded by frames or marble pedestals. Any image or landscape
which delightfully arrests contemplation is a poetic image for
Oakeshott.

**[Activity for its Own Sake]{.underline}**

Oakeshott takes from Aristotle the idea of activity done for its own
sake, without Aristotle's teleology. For Aristotle of the [Nicomachean
Ethics]{.underline} and [The Metaphysics]{.underline}, the only activity
which, carefully speaking, can be done for its own sake, is activity in
which intellect acts upon intellect, as in the case of the Unmoved Mover
which thinks itself. For the ontological dualist, Aristotle, activity in
which thought acts upon matter (e.g,. shoemaking) is always for some
other, utilitarian purpose (e.g., to wear and walk in the shoes).
Politics, to illustrate further for Aristotle, is a hybrid activity,
existing both for its own sake (justice) and for some external sake
(public order).

Oakeshott, follows here the 16^th^ century essayist, Montaigne, in the
view that all sorts of mundane activity can be done for its own sake,
such as conversation, friendship, and so on. Arguably, it took the long,
historical influence of the symbolism of the incarnate
[logos]{.underline} to displace Aristotle's view that only the
theoretical life could be for its own sake, with no extraneous purpose
(though mundane activities could have residual practical and productive
benefits).^4^

This seems especially true of ritualistic practices in which the delight
comes not so much in the outcome, but simply in getting the practice
right. As Oakeshott observes, one lights another's cigarette, not
because they cannot do it themselves, but simply because "it is the
practice." Oakeshott also observes of fishing that it can become a
practice done for its own sake if one is indifferent to actually
catching fish. (Though we may observe that fish caught even
indifferently can still be consumed for nourishment). In general,
Oakeshott's view of contented living in a very practical and
technological age and civilization, is (as with Montaigne) to structure
one's life insofar as possible, around doing as many things as
intelligently possible and appropriate, for their own sake, and in the
present moment rather than for complicated future projects requiring the
extensive use of others as mere means for one's own projects.

**[Implications of Oakeshott's Escapes from "the Deadliness of
Doing"]{.underline}**

In my view Oakeshott's view of contented living and the limited place of
labor and meaningful work in the contemporary world is discerning,
intelligent, and persuasive. Unlike Nietzsche, he does not simply view
the idea of the "dignity of work" and the "dignity of human beings" as
attempts to reconcile ourselves to the *slavery* and regimentation
accompanying modern mass production, which are to be rejected wholesale
by discerning superior individuals. Oakeshott is also unlike Rousseau
who, like Nietzsche and the ancient Greeks, views a laboring life as
slavery, yet offers as an antidote the romantic, "either-or" choice
between a life of private reveries, [or]{.underline} Spartan-like
devotion to the common, political good. Unlike the neo-Calvinist, Locke,
Oakeshott does not praise human labor, only then to degrade it as merely
a means to ownership. Unlike Marx, Oakeshott does not promise the
fantastic overcoming of all human alienation from itself and its
products through huge economic surpluses to be generated by the
syntheses of capitalist egoism and medieval "Gemeinschaft." And unlike
Pieper who appears to want a general recognition of the importance of
leisure in the generation of higher culture without attention to the
economic surpluses necessary for this, Oakeshott simply offers (like
Montaigne) an intelligent, private approach for individuals so inclined
to navigate the obstacles to contented living in whatever novel
historical circumstances.

As for the common sense charge that this approach bespeaks a timidity
and lack of ambition in eschewing laborious engagement to better one's
social status ("the American dream"), the best reply is that this choice
need not be either the cause, nor outcome of a lack of nerve, but rather
simply the preference for a private over a public life, grounded in the
insight that the private things are the most appropriate for creatures
such as [most of us]{.underline} situated in a world of contingency and
flux. Such an approach to contented and appropriate living allows one to
suspend judgment on such speculative questions as to whether there is a
purpose to the whole or [cosmos]{.underline} to validate a laborious
life. (Oakeshott appears to have thought it beyond our capacities to
know^5^, and he also appears not to have thought it necessary to have
taken Pascal's wager).

By way of illustrating in more detail what such a life would look like,
let us look at Oakeshott's approach to friendship, conversation and
ritual, and how it resembles and also differs from Montaigne's more
Lucretian/Epicurean approach to an appropriate human life. We shall see
that Oakeshott's is a more aesthetic and ritualistic approach to
combatting the monotony and "deadliness" of a life of "doing," grounded
in Oakeshott's acceptance and embrace of the structure of reality as the
poetic (vs prosaic).^6^

Oakeshott's description of friendship is the most aesthetic known to me,
and differs from the Aristotelian, the Epicurean/Lucretian and even the
Montaignian account in not privileging the worthiness of a friend.
Consider this unique Oakeshottian account of friendship:

> But there are relationships ... in which no result is sought and which
> are enraged in for their own sake ... This is so of friendship ...
> Friends are not concerned with what might be made of one another, but
> only with the enjoyment of one another ... and the absence of any
> desire to change or improve ... A friend is not someone who ... holds
> certain acceptable opinions: he is somebody who ... excites
> contemplation ... and delight and loyalty on account of the
> relationship entered into. One friend cannot replace another.^7^

Consider also in the context of this highly stylized and aesthetic
Oakeshottien account, his discussion of conversation, which for
Montaigne, by contrast, is praised for its instruction in the search for
truth. Here is Oakeshott's account of conversation as purged of any
purposes which would qualify its being done solely for the delight of
conversing:

> In conversation the participants are not engaged in an inquiry or a
> debate; there is no truth to be discovered ... Of course, a
> conversation may have passages of argument ... but reasoning is
> neither sovereign nor alone ... In conversation thoughts of different
> species take wing and play around one another .... And enjoy an
> oblique relationship which neither requires nor forecasts their being
> assimilated to one another.^8^

Oakeshott is also more explicit than Montaigne on his characterization
and valuation of "ritual" in a human life. In my view, Oakeshott
separates out the formal from the substantive aspects of an activity as
an alternative to the monopoly and deadening of an orientation
exclusively focused on practical existence. Oakeshott's formalist
orientation entails respect and appreciation for/of the ritualistic
aspects of activity -- that is those aspects done solely for their own
sake, literally (even if they also have some residual practical
benefits). Here is an instance of Oakeshott's thinking on this score
with regard to fishing:

> There are activities that may be engaged in, not for a prize, but for
> the enjoyment they generate ... Consider fishing ... Fishing is an
> activity that may be engaged in, not for the profit of a catch, *but
> for its own sake*. \[W\]here this is so, *the activity has become a
> ritual* and \[W\]hat matters is the enjoyment of exercising skill (or
> merely passing the time) ... ^9^

Now, in my view this expansive Oakeshottian account of ritualistic
practice is based on Oakeshott's ontological claim that structure of
reality is "poetic" (not prosaic), that is, that the form and content,
the how and what, of activity and thought arise simultaneously and
condition one another reciprocally. This Oakeshottian claim about the
importance of formal rituals as well as informal rituals (such as
fishing to pass the time) has broader cultural and political
implications which it is instructive to note, and which prefigure much
recent assessment on the costs of loss of ritual in contemporary
life.^10^ Oakeshott's account of these costs is a part of his general
critique of the baneful affects of the modern rationalist invasion of
politics and morality since Bacon and Descartes, and they include the
deterioration and loss of genuine skill and moral balance, as well as an
increased prevalence of war and conflict generally.^11^

By way of concluding this exploration of the implications of Oakeshott's
beguiling phrase "the deadliness of doing," let us make a most unlikely
comparison on the effects of loss of ritual in especially Western
religious culture in contributing to the disastrous wars of the first
half of the twentieth century. Let us look an account of the causes of
especially the first world war in the thought of a thinker Oakeshott
never discussed, but who shared the view that the loss of (especially
religious) ritual in the cultural monopoly of the rationalist
[Weltanshauung]{.underline} had led to moral and political chaos. Let us
look briefly at the thought of the depth psychologist, Carl Jung, on the
deeper causes of the first world war.

In some lectures on psychology and religion given at Yale in 1937, Jung
made the following claim, especially with reference to "the adventurous
German tribes." In brief, Jung argued that the rationalist monopoly of
modern science and technology had forgotten the unaccountable forces of
the unconscious mind, and, in combination with the Protestant
suppression of daily, ritualistic religious reflection (the rosary) in
the lives of millions of European Catholics (which he thought a safe and
stable way of moderating these hidden forces), had produced the "dragons
which devoured the earth." ^12^

Now, while Oakeshott would never have accepted this kind of general
"covering law" psychological explanation of major events, his
conclusions about the disastrous and chaotic moral and military
consequences of the modern rationalist project to eliminate as much as
possible the influence of ritual and custom in the lives of millions of
people by mandating more rationalist solutions to rationalist-generated
chaos (especially war) parallel Jung's psychological explanations for
the wars of the twentieth century. Additionally, Jung's claims suggest a
more literal meaning to Oakeshott's phrase "the deadliness of doing,"
which Oakeshott may simply have implied about the unsatisfactoriness of
a life of doing *without still reflection* on the being behind it, an
addictive temptation ever-present in the feverish Baconian scientific
project to master and exploit the resources of the physical world as an
end in itself.

**Notes**

1.  This phrase occurs only twice in Oakeshott's work, in the essay on
    the voice of poetry, and in *On Human Conduct*, as a path of
    intermittent escape from the monopoly of practical and scientific
    discourse in the modern world. The phrase "the deadliness of doing"
    has been discovered (by Noel O'Sullivan) in a Victorian hymn,
    perhaps intended (?) as a dramatic critique of the doctrine of
    salvation through works alone, or a caution against aggressive
    proselyticizing.

2.  For development of this theme, see Wendell J. Coats, and Chor-Yung
    Cheung, *The Poetic Character of Human Activity*, (Lanham, MD,
    Lexington Books, 2012).

3.  Oakeshott acknowledges that philosophy is parasitic on practical
    human life, and often is under the illusion that it can replace,
    rather than merely transcend, practical experience (to include a
    life of physical or intellectual labor.) This is a recurring theme
    of Oakeshott's book *Experience and its Modes*. (Cambridge:
    Cambridge University Press, 1933). On Oakeshott's account, action is
    merely *incipient* thought or image-making.

4.  The argument has been made that Augustine's trinitarian reflections
    on the human personality as a mixture of belief, thought and will,
    bridged the unsatisfactory gap in ancient idealism and ancient
    materialism, between thought and matter. (See Charles Cochrane,
    *Christianity and Classical Culture*, London: Oxford UP, 1957)
    Oakeshott's constructivism owes something to the medieval nominalism
    of William of Okham for whom human beings could imitate God's
    creativity in "Speaking" the beings of the world (*universalia sunt
    nomina*). For more on this, see A. de Muralt, *L'enjeau de la
    Philosophie Medieval*, Leiden, E.J. Brill, 1991..

5.  Oakeshott, (1933). P. 287. "The valuable never even appears to be
    the whole, nor the universe ... to be valuable." For Oakeshott, the
    valuable is confined to the realm of practical experience. (Contrast
    someone such as Augustine for whom the world clearly exists to
    provide tests for the perfection of souls on their journey to
    godliness.)
