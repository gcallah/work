The spiritualization of work: Luther and the dual vocation

Orsolya Horváth

The exaltation of the dung-shovelling maid

In 1530, in Wittenberg, Luther held a mid-week sermon series (lectio
continua) on the Sermon on the Mount,[^1] including the Beatitudes, the
sixth statement of which reads as follows: „Blessed are the pure in
heart, for they will see God." (Mt 5:8) But who are the pure in heart
who will see God? Luther\'s commentary confused his audience just as
much as it does today's readers because it goes against the natural way
of thinking; according to which, a person with a pure heart is one who
can keep himself away from the world's filth and can live a
contemplative life, during which only divine things occupy his
attention. Contrasting the filthy world and pure spirituality was as
natural in the 16th century as it is in the early 21st century - even if
for partly different reasons. Contrary to it, Luther tells the citizens
of Wittenberg the following: the only thing that can be achieved with a
contemplative life away from the world is that the heart becomes impure;
the person falls into ungodliness because he is driven by his own -- as
Luther explains it -- imaginations and dreams. If someone wants to be
pure in heart, he can achieve it not by turning away from, but by
turning towards the world, by living in it. Luther takes this so
seriously that the blacksmith and the cobbler who reek of tar and pitch,
and the servant who walks in filth up to his neck and even shovels dung
become the paradigm of a pure-hearted person for him. Does the smell of
these manual laborers repel us? As it turns out, they are the
pure-hearted ones.[^2] In my study, I investigate this surprise and ask:
How can the dung-shovelling maid become the paradigm of a believer for
Luther?[^3]

Luther on work

First, let us take a purely descriptive look at how important work is to
Luther. In 1523, he drafted an unusual document,[^4] in which he gave
concrete advice to the young Lutheran congregation in Leisnig on how to
manage their treasury and material assets, which largely originated from
the monasteries' wealth. In this advice, Luther shows a strong social
sensitivity and explains that the city\'s well-being is inconceivable
without promoting the well-being of marginalized people. However, he
does not intend to solve it with usury or begging, but with work.

> No men or women beggars shall be tolerated in our parish, either in
> the city or in the villages, since anyone not incapacitated by reason
> of age or illness shall work or, with the aid of the authorities, be
> expelled from the parish, the city, and the villages[^5]

\- says his firm statement. However, at the same time, it also considers
those who cannot work due to their impoverishment and establishes a
refundable aid to support their return to work.

> To artisans and others suffering in private, whether married or
> widowers, who are residents of the city and villages within our parish
> and who are honestly unable to ply their trade or other urban or rural
> occupation, and have no other source of help, the directors shall
> advance an appropriate amount out of the common chest, to be repaid at
> some future date.[^6]

Luther differentiates even further:

> In cases where despite honest and diligent toil they are unable to
> make repayment, the debt shall be forgiven for God's sake as a
> contribution to their need. Such circumstances shall be carefully
> investigated by the directors.[^7]

The proposal on how to manage the treasury also considers those who
cannot work: the sick, the elderly, and those monks who are unable to do
so due to their being unskilled.

> But those among us who are impoverished by force of circum-stances, or
> are unable to work because of old age or illness, shall be supported
> in suitable fashion by the ten officials out of our common chest.[^8]
> We must remember, too, that these persons \[i.e. monks\] have drifted
> into this estate as a result of the blindness and error which
> prevailed generally, and have never learned a trade by which they
> could support themselves.[^9]

From the above, it is clear how important Luther considers working:
community aid is decided according to whether someone can work. However,
work is not only important from the aspect of social well-being but also
from that of individual well-being. In the following, we will examine
where the roots of this idea can be found in his theology.

Christocentric ontology

Unlike Luther, with certain thinkers it is often difficult, even
impossible, to define a single focus point around which the whole
thinking is organized. For him, at the same time, there is only one
center, Jesus Christ, and all questions arise around it and within its
scope. From our original point of departure, Luther\'s Christocentric
thinking first emphasizes that in Jesus Christ, God came - from the
distant and inaccessible heaven - to earth, to people, and even became a
man. Therefore, the direction of his movement is downward. And if God
acted like this in Christ, how can anyone think he can reach God by
moving upward, contrary to his movement? According to Luther, a
contemplative life away from the world justifies this upward movement
i.e. contrary to the reality of Christ. God\'s downward movement is not
aimless, its purpose is to show people divine mercy. Consequently, the
purpose of human life is also to exercise mercy, since Christ set an
example for this. Just as God practiced mercy among people, which is why
he came to earth, so man must live in this world, otherwise, he would
not be able to practice acts of mercy. And, since living in the world is
only realized by leading an active life, work is considered an
indispensable part of this active life. Working, practicing mercy, and
following Christ are closely intertwined for Luther. Therefore, working
is crucial not only from the point of view of social good but also from
that of individual good; ultimately, it is a part of religious practice.
However, the formula of Christocentric thinking about work seems simple
only at first glance. Like any other topic, the work issue, for Luther,
is woven into the reality of Christ with a thousand threads. So let us
try to follow these threads, because this is how the novelty of
Luther\'s concept of work can be revealed.

The figure of Jesus Christ is a paradox in itself, since in him the
infinite God became a finite man, while, at the same time, remaining an
infinite God. Thus, such a combination is realized in his person, which
can only be thought of as a paradox within the framework of traditional
logic. In the Lutheran understanding, this paradox is emphasized in
several respects.[^10] On the one hand, in an anthropological sense, and
on the other in a geographical one. According to the latter, after God
became man in Christ, two such \"places\" that could not meet before,
met: heaven and earth, but they did not meet in-between, but on earth.
The ruler of the heavenly kingdom is God; and, the ruler of the earthly
kingdom, although ultimately, is also God, it is Satan\'s area of
​​operation. Temporarily, he is \"the ruler of this world\" (Jn 14:30).
With the meeting of the two \"places\" on earth, the character of the
earth became paradoxical, as it became the area of ​​operation of God
and Satan at the same time, even if God\'s supremacy is unquestionable.
The commonly used two-realm doctrine describes this duality. Luther
consistently presents this paradoxical operation by contrasting
appearance with reality. The same act or event in the world, which is
the result of Satan\'s operation, is also the hidden operation of God.
Christ\'s death on the cross is the paradigm for this: death on the
cross is the greatest failure, and at the same time, the most complete
victory. Accordingly, earthly things - using Luther\'s technical term -,
are masks. Masks that show something different than what they are, but
behind which God\'s reality is hidden. In this sense, does Luther talk
about work as a mask: it seems as if a person -- during work -- is only
occupied with his prosperity, but if we look behind the mask, we see
that he is working for God\'s sake.[^11]

The paradox is also present in anthropology: if a person believes in
Christ, he acquires a kind of dual citizenship: he also becomes a
citizen of the kingdom of God in the above sense, in addition to the
satanic rule that is definitely active in earthly life. This paradoxical
ontology defines man\'s existence in several versions: alongside his
finitude, he has become a part of eternity, despite his limited
understanding, he has received the vision of faith, as a sinner, he has
become righteous, etc. It is important to emphasize this because we
misunderstand the entire Lutheran teaching on work if we forget that
Luther\'s worker is the person who believes in Christ and that
everything he states about work presupposes that the person doing the
work believes in Christ. So if we want to be precise, we do not ask what
Luther teaches about work, but what Luther teaches about the believer's
work.

Luther on vocation

Precisely because Luther talks about work as a part of religious
practice, as a condition for the realization of divine mercy, and at the
same time as a mask of God\'s operation, work is transformed into a
vocation; ultimately, the concept of vocation acquires a new meaning at
Luther because the perception of work is spiritualized.

The writing, On Good Deeds, published in 1520, is one of the first
thematic expositions of Luther\'s ethics in the form of a sermon
explaining the Ten Commandments.[^12] Here we find one of the first
explanations of the far-reaching ethical consequences of making faith
the basis of ethical thinking.

> For in this work all good works exist, and from faith these works
> receive a borrowed goodness. We must make this absolutely clear.[^13]

The roots of the new way of thinking about work can also be found here.
Luther boldly accepts and proclaims the practical consequences of this
insight.

> If you ask further whether they consider it a good work when a man
> works at his trade, walks, stands, eats, drinks, sleeps, and does all
> kinds of works for the nourishment of his body or for the common
> welfare, and whether they believe that God is well pleased with them,
> you will find that they say no, and that they define good works so
> narrowly that they are made to consist only of praying in church,
> fasting, and almsgiving. The other things they consider as worth
> nothing and think that God attaches no importance to them. And so,
> through their damnable unbelief, they deprive God of his due and
> despise faith, though God is served by all things that may be done,
> spoken, or thought in faith.[^14]

The range of actions pleasing to God extends to all areas of everyday
human life, including work. It is not only in church and a monastery
that it is possible to do something that pleases God: as if Luther,
through faith, turned every place of everyday life into a church, the
barn as well as the workshop, the kitchen as well as the field.

However, he does not stop at expanding the consecrated space but
contrasts the everyday actions sanctified by faith with the hypocritical
ones of monastic life. In the writing entitled The Babylonian Captivity
of the Church, also from 1520,[^15] he formulates this contrast for the
first time, which he then continues to represent.

> Therefore I advise no one to enter any religious order or the
> priesthood, indeed, I advise everyone against it---unless he is
> forearmed with this knowledge and understands that the works of monks
> and priests, however holy and arduous they may be, do not differ one
> whit in the sight of God from the works of the rustic laborer in the
> field or the woman going about her household tasks, but that all works
> are measured before God by faith alone. \[...\] Indeed, the menial
> housework of a manservant or maidservant is often more acceptable to
> God than all the fastings and other works of a monk or priest, because
> the monk or priest lacks faith.[^16]

Everyday work thus becomes a distinguished activity, a vocation, thanks
to faith, and is ultimately based on the fact that the everyday person
is in direct contact with God through faith, i.e. he is a priest. Luther
gives dignity to the work of everyday people in his thinking because he
gives dignity to everyday people and everyday life[^17] -- in his view,
this follows from the reality of Jesus Christ. It may be that when we
ask what Luther\'s main legacy is from the point of view of our present,
it is above all the strong affirmation of life that shines through all
of Luther\'s writings even in the most impossible situations.

Before Luther\'s time, there were limited ideas about the possibilities
of leading a holy life. Two types of earthly life were distinguished:
one was the life within the Church, i.e. that of the clergy, and the
other outside it, that of the laity. In this way, the monastery wall
separated the holy and the profane based on the daily activities. The
term vocation was used exclusively for holy vocation, i.e. entering the
Church. It is only at Luther that work becomes a vocation, whatever it
may be, even like that of a dung-shovelling maid, because this way of
thinking no longer looks at actions, but at faith. I have the impression
that in this recognition it is not so much the recognition itself that
is extraordinary, but how determined and serious Luther is when he
examines and justifies all the consequences of this recognition; as can
be seen from his already quoted early ethics:

> In this faith all works become equal, and one work is like the other;
> all distinctions between works fall away, whether they be great,
> small, short, long, many, or few. For the works are acceptable not for
> their own sake but because of faith, which is always the same and
> lives and works in each and every work without distinction, however
> numerous and varied these works always are.[^18]

But if faith is taken out of the formula, as I have already emphasized
in another context, then no job is a vocation - at least immanently,
from a human point of view.

Ordinary life as a Christocentric life: the dual vocation

We have seen that Luther advocates an active life in the world instead
of a retreat from the world, but this seems to have confused us. After
all, the question arises: Is there no need to withdraw from the world in
the reformed faith? Where and how does the believer's work find
spiritual nourishment, namely, worship that also moves everyday life,
and thanks to which even dung-shovelling appears differently to him than
before? If work becomes a vocation for faith, as we said, how can this
faith be born and grow without some retreat? And if withdrawal is still
necessary, how different is it from the one we abandoned? Thus how does
Luther picture the everyday life of a person fulfilling his vocation?

In 1523, he wrote Concerning the Order of Public Worship,[^19] which,
despite its brevity, served as a guide for many newly established
congregations to organize their community life. This document shows how
Luther thought about the above question.

> This was the custom among Christians at the time of the apostles and
> should also be the custom now. We should assemble daily at four or
> five in the morning and have \[God's Word\] read, either by pupils or
> priests, or whoever it may be, in the same manner as the lesson is
> still read at Matins.[^20] \[...\] In like manner, come together at
> five or six in the evening.[^21]

So, before going to work, and after completing the day\'s work, ideally,
the person doing the work meets the others for an hour to listen to the
Scriptures and their explanation. This is the source from which they get
motivation to do their work as a profession, since

> thus Christian people will by daily training become proficient,
> skilful, and well versed in the Bible. For this is how genuine
> Christians were made in former times---both virgins and martyrs---and
> could also be made today.[^22]

In Luther\'s view, this does not mean an extra burden for man, but

> for all that matters is that the Word of God be given free reign to
> uplift and quicken souls so that they do not become weary.[^23]

It is not as if Luther idealized human nature: he saw the obstacles that
daily gatherings could encounter, which is why in this document he is
also lenient; however, he insists on all the people meeting at least
once a week. Therefore, even though Luther is hostile towards the
monastic life withdrawn from the world, he does not abandon the act of
withdrawing from the world itself. However, the relationship between
this withdrawal and life in the world changes completely. While
previously listening to God meant turning away from the world, now
listening to God goes hand in hand with leading an active life in the
world. Neither can be abandoned without the other suffering damage.
Generally, man\'s relationship with God and the world is dynamized by
the fact that the walls separating the sacred and profane spaces
collapse. From here on, man is not a prisoner of one or the other; his
life is spent in a dynamic movement between the two. As if changing the
focus of his attention: sometimes he pays attention to God, and
sometimes to his work because this is the only way he can do his work
devotedly and listen to God and his word with devotion. This dynamic of
everyday life is indispensable for Luther, which also means that
everyday work can only be ennobled as a vocation if the person doing the
work has another vocation, namely the relationship with God.[^24] Thus,
for Luther, the everyday person has -- as I call it -- a dual
vocation,[^25] the dynamics of which determine his everyday life.

However, this does not mean that the time of listening to God is sharply
separated from the time of work. Since, precisely because the everyday
person devotes time to God and the Holy Scriptures, it can seep into his
everyday work. This is a condition for work to become a vocation, since
in this way work is filled with spirit, and on the other hand - as
Luther emphasizes, in the series of sermons cited at the beginning of
the study - it is during work that insights about God's things can
arise, indirectly. Its significance for Luther is that, in this way,
recognition is not the result of a person\'s striving (as in
monasticism), but rather a gift to him received during his work. In this
way, work as a vocation also becomes, in the strict sense of the word, a
means of growing in the knowledge of God. It is as if Luther pours
holiness onto the world, since, in his opinion, the reality of Christ
did this.

Global good order and self-realization

Although Luther firmly stated that there is no difference between
actions in themselves, since faith alone makes a difference, he did not
imagine the world as chaos, where every action or work observes faith
and mercy alone. In the Confession concerning Christ\'s supper
(1528)[^26] we find how Luther saw the foundations of the social order
of the world, which he already spoke about in 1519.[^27]

> The holy orders and true religious institutions established by God are
> these three: the office of priest, the estate of marriage, the civil
> government,[^28]

i.e. the orders of the church, the family, and the state.[^29] He
considers these three as holy orders based on the Scriptures. However,
it does not mean that they are untouchable, only that they have a divine
origin. Within these orders are the individual offices, i.e.
occupations, many of which are specifically mentioned in several places,
such as preacher, mother, servant, judge, mayor, etc.[^30] Thus, all
decent work and occupations fit into the previous holy arrangement,
whereby they become part of the divine order. So far we have followed
how the vocation is immanently founded in Luther - there is no denying
that this is the really exciting question by Luther; now we can also see
how the foundation takes place from a transcendent point of view. The
three divine orders also fit into the higher unity of believers, so
there are indeed differences between the individual occupations and
orders, but the differences are relative at both levels, because, as
Luther says, „a Christian people is undivided".[^31] Among the specific
professions, Luther mentions not only those that fit into this good
order without any problems, as did the above ones, but also those that
seem to confuse the structure outlined here: an example was the cleaning
of sheds and stables, due to the stench and the degree of contempt, but
also the military profession, to which Luther dedicated a separate
booklet (Whether soldiers, too, can be saved \[1526\][^32]), and which
also leads back to love.[^33]

Looking at all of this, it seems that Luther\'s thinking about work,
even though it reaches even the most despised everyday lives, is
determined more from the point of view of divine origin: alignment with
God determines his thinking, rather than the sense of justice, desire,
fatigue and vulnerability of ordinary people. Luther is not a
revolutionary, nor is his immediate goal the ending of the exploitation
of workers. He believes in that new, eternal life without suffering and
fatigue. From this aspect, everyday life appears as a preparation for
this. That is why he ultimately expands the concept of vocation; and why
he mainly talks about how to stay in a profession, rather than how to
find a new one; about how a person\'s attitude to his work can change,
rather than about how he could do something else; that is, about faith
rather than about action. And, although we cannot ignore this clear set
of values ​​of Luther\'s, which may seem outdated insofar as the faith
itself is, if at all - we would still be unfair to Luther if we did not
see the tendencies in which he specifically turns towards everyday life,
which we tried to highlight in this analysis. These are the
repercussions of the value system in question on everyday life, since
after this does not the Christian farmer turn differently to the
servant, the father to the mother, the master to the servant, and vice
versa?; on the other hand, Luther\'s direct ideas for the improvement of
individual and community everyday life, as exemplified by the Leisnig
case. There is no doubt that Luther\'s focus is far from
self-realization or nurturing talent,[^34] in his thinking, however, he
takes into account the character of the person holding the office and
the issue of suitability; he advocates education, and he does not
consider higher offices untouchable.

In addition, for him, everyday life does not gain its dignity simply by
improving living conditions, but only by connecting people to Christ.
That is why the dung-shovelling maid became a distinguished example for
him. As he summarized in 1523 in an already quoted document:

> For the whole Scripture shows that the Word should have free course
> among Christians. And in Luke 10 \[:42\], Christ himself says, "One
> thing is needful," i.e., that Mary sit at the feet of Christ and hear
> his word daily. This is the best part to choose and it shall not be
> taken away forever. It is an eternal Word. Everything else must pass
> away, no matter how much care and trouble it may give Martha.[^35]
