The genesis for this project was reading the material on work 
from Karl Löwith’s *From Hegel to Nietzsche*
and being struck by how divergent the
views of work were even on one continent (and mostly from one country!)
during the course of one century.  I gradually began
collecting snippets of writings about work from over the centuries, and thought
it would be useful to explore however variously it has been conceived by
different major thinkers. These conceptions run the gamut from viewing work as
positively opposed to living the best life, to seeing it as the most essential
part of living the best life.

How did this almost schizophrenic view of work come about? And how did various
thinkers defend their positive or negative evaluations of work?

These questions are vital to contemporary liberalism, and to its critics, as a
vital issue dividing liberals from their critics -- Marxist, distributist,
post-liberal, etc. -- is the role of work in human life.

Rebel, refugee, and political thinker, Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) is
renowned for grappling with grave themes. She attempted to make sense of
the horrors of the twentieth century and to understand the human
experience in the context of modernity. Because she centered this
exposition on how we approach work and activity, rather than our traits
and dispositions, her schema for understanding what it means to be human
is especially relevant to the aims of this volume. Arendt's framework
for thinking about something typically considered quotidian---the human
experience of work---has been impactful, generating attention in fields
as diverse as sociology, occupational science, and management
studies.[^1] These days, scholars and pundits look to Arendt to reckon
with various socio-political ills, such as "the decline of liberal
democracy, the spread of fake news, the rise of the social sphere, the
triumph of technology, the loss of the private realm and the experience
of mass loneliness."[^2] Her work is not above reproach, however, as
feminists and democratic theorists alike have criticized aspects of her
oeuvre.[^3]

Posited in her treatise *The Human Condition* (1958), her distinctions
between labor, work, and action offer a typology of the human effort we
call work. This chapter provides an overview of Arendt's categories of
