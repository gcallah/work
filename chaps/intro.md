# Introduction

Gene Callahan, New York University

The genesis for this project was reading the material on work 
from Karl Löwith's *From Hegel to Nietzsche*
and being struck by how divergent the
views of work were even on one continent (and mostly from one country!)
during the course of one century.  I gradually began
collecting snippets of writings about work from over the centuries, and thought
it would be useful to explore how variously it has been conceived by
different major thinkers. These conceptions run the gamut from viewing work as
positively opposed to living the best life, to seeing it as the most essential
part of living the best life.

How did this almost schizophrenic view of work come about? And how did various
thinkers defend their positive or negative evaluations of work? This volume was assembled in order to collect in one
place some of the thoughts of some of the most significant theorists of work in the Western tradition.

## Plato (427–348 BCE) and Aristotle (384–322 BCE)

James Murphy highlights a fascinating paradox in Plato and Aristotle's evaluation of work: both philosophers extol the
virtues of craftsmanship while simultaneously denigrating craftsmen. W.B. Yeats pondered, "How can we know the dancer
from the dance?" A similar question arises regarding Plato and Aristotle: How do they differentiate between the act of
craftsmanship and the craftsman themselves, and why do they revere the former while disparaging the latter?

Both philosophers exclude craftsmen from the ranks of citizenship. Yet, Plato refers to his ideal rulers as "the best
possible craftsmen" and describes ruling as "the royal craft." They both admire the intellectual knowledge required for
skilled work but criticize the manual skill and labor involved. They celebrate those who conceptualize tasks but
belittle those who execute them. This perspective reflects their broader belief in the superior dignity of intellectual
over physical pursuits. Consequently, they fail to recognize that a craftsman's knowledge is inherently tied to their
manual skills, and that true craftsmanship embodies the unity of mind and hand.

## The New Testament

The New Testament introduced a transformative view of 'work' into Western thought. Unlike the arduous labor avoided by
Hellenic philosophers or the Hebraic notion of divine creation, work in the New Testament is redefined as God's saving
act. In this new context, human labor is seen as secondary to divine work.

While the Pauline and Lutheran doctrines distinguish between 'justification by faith' and 'justification by works,' such
a distinction is less clear when considering the full spectrum of work in the New Testament. Various terms for 'work'
appear: not only *ergon* (effective act), but also *kopos* (burdensome act) and *ponos* (painful act). Additionally, terms
like *praxis* and *poiesis* (the roots of 'practice' and 'poetry') and words denoting specific significant acts--such as
healings, miracles, signs, and resurrection--illustrate the complexity of work. The New Testament addresses both ordinary
toil and the divine work of healing and preaching, culminating in the salvific work of God through Jesus' crucifixion
and resurrection. The Christian tradition does not diminish the value of work but rather emphasizes trust in God's work.

## Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas did not primarily focus on the topic of work. His discussions on the subject emerged in the context of
defending religious orders that no longer engaged in manual labor. The most frequently cited texts on this topic are
found in a Quodlibet, a public disputation question rather than a treatise he selected for its intrinsic significance.
Though his early arguments were later expanded in his theological summaries, they consistently address the question of
whether religious orders were obligated to perform manual work. Thus, a comprehensive "Thomistic theory of work" must be
pieced together from these dispersed references rather than from a fully developed doctrine.

Despite this, Aquinas remains a significant figure in modern discussions, particularly in economics. Some scholars view
him as a precursor to Adam Smith's ideas on the division of labor or even Karl Marx's labor theory of value, while
others argue that he advocated for a more "humane" economy, critiquing capitalism before its time. Although these
interpretations reflect Aquinas’s lasting influence, his primary focus was theological, specifically
soteriological—concerning human salvation—rather than social or economic issues. To grasp his perspective, one must
delve into his original texts, preceded by an understanding of their terminology and historical context.


## Martin Luther (1483–1546)

In 1530, Martin Luther delivered a mid-week sermon series in Wittenberg on the Sermon on the Mount, including the
Beatitudes. One statement that particularly puzzled his audience then and continues to intrigue readers today is:
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God" (Matthew 5:8). Luther's interpretation of this passage challenges
conventional views, which often associate purity of heart with a life removed from worldly distractions, focusing solely
on divine contemplation.

In the 16th century, as in the early 21st century, there was a strong contrast between the corrupt world and the ideal
of pure spirituality. Luther, however, upends this traditional dichotomy. He argues that a contemplative life, detached
from the world, only leads to impurity and ungodliness, as it fosters delusions and fantasies. Instead, Luther posits
that true purity of heart is achieved not by withdrawing from the world but by engaging with it. For him, the
blacksmith, the cobbler with tar-stained hands, and even the dung-shoveling servant embody the essence of purity. This
surprising notion raises a question: How does the dung-shoveling maid come to represent the ideal believer in Luther's
view?

## Francis Bacon (1561–1626)

In modern thought, nature is often seen as an obstacle to human well-being, necessitating human intervention and
technological innovation. Francis Bacon, a pivotal figure in shaping this modern perspective, viewed nature's resistance
as a central problem. This chapter will focus on one crucial element that influenced Bacon’s understanding of nature’s
resistance and how it might be overcome: the Judeo-Christian concept of the fall of man, as described in Genesis 3.

Bacon’s interpretation of the fall frames the central human predicament as the loss of dominion over nature. According
to Bacon, this loss necessitates constant labor, as humanity must toil to meet its material needs. The prevailing
approach to understanding nature has, in his view, failed to yield practical technological advances. Bacon believed that
a more effective method of natural inquiry could potentially restore humanity's dominion and allow us to achieve the
divine rest for which we were originally created. This, I argue, represents Bacon's vision.

## John Locke (1632–1704)

John Locke's theories on labor and property are well-explored, but they remain provocative. Traditionally, Locke is seen
as a natural law theorist who justifies property rights through labor, asserting that labor fulfills a moral duty of
self-preservation. Interpretations of Locke’s work generally fall into three categories: one that aligns him with
classical liberalism and libertarianism; another that critiques him for justifying exploitative market practices; and a
third that dismisses his ideas as outdated. These interpretations often reflect the biases of individual scholars more
than Locke's actual arguments.

Despite the familiarity of Locke's work, some argue that there are important nuances worth revisiting. Ferrell suggests
that a closer examination of Locke’s position could reveal overlooked aspects and offer fresh insights into his
controversial ideas.

## Adam Smith (1723–1790)

Adam Smith, a Scottish thinker and professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Glasgow, is widely regarded as the
father of economics, primarily due to his seminal work, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.

Among his many contributions, the concept of the “invisible hand” is perhaps the most famous. However, the division of
labor is also a key idea closely associated with Smith. According to Paganelli, Smith considered the division of labor
essential for creating a prosperous and happy society. Both concepts have been extensively interpreted and sometimes
misused, but they remain central to understanding Smith’s economic thought.

## Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831)

Hegel's intricate and abstract philosophy often obscures the critical role that labor—engagement with the physical and
material world—plays in the development of self-consciousness and the rational state. Marx, in his 1844 Manuscripts,
recognized this when he noted that Hegel "grasps labor as the essence of man," though he did so critically. This chapter
aims to explore labor's significant yet frequently overlooked role in Hegelian philosophy by examining two major texts.
We will first analyze its foundational role in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit and then explore its place in the
Philosophy of Right. This analysis will reveal how labor is portrayed as both integral to human self-consciousness and
as a component embedded in and threatened by civil society.

## Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855)

Though Søren Kierkegaard's writings rarely address labor or economics directly, his views on labor are relevant due to
his broader insights into the nature of personal vocation. Kierkegaard presents labor not merely as a mundane activity
but as a component of one's spiritual calling. He argues that every individual has a unique vocation and that despite
social differences, all individuals stand equal before God in their pursuit of this calling.

## Giovanni Gentile (1875–1944)

Giovanni Gentile, a leading Italian philosopher of the twentieth century, developed a "humanism of labor" in his
posthumously published work, *Genesis and Structure of Society* (1946). Gentile saw modern understanding of labor as
spiritually valuable, akin to his view of culture. He emphasized the profound connection between intellectual and manual
labor and the "Absolute Spirit," arguing that both types of labor hold methodological significance. Gentile's thesis
highlights the importance of the interaction between intellectuals and workers, positing a genuine union of labor and
culture within the framework of human values.

## Max Weber (1864–1920)

In *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism*, Max Weber famously linked the rise of modern capitalism to the
"Protestant ethic," which he argued fostered a new attitude towards work and capital accumulation. Callahan
assesses the validity of Weber’s thesis, which has been both influential and controversial. He summarizes key debates
surrounding Weber’s argument and explores how critics, as Stephen Kallberg notes, often fail to fully grasp the
complexity of Weber's analysis.

## Ludwig von Mises (1881–1973)

The adage "A bad day of fishing is better than a good day at work" reflects a deeper understanding of the relationship
between labor and leisure. This relationship is central to Ludwig von Mises’s analysis in *Human Action*. Mises critiques
the socialist view, notably by Karl Kautsky, which suggests that socialism could transform the discomfort of labor into
pleasure. According to Mises, labor is inherently unpleasant because it involves discomfort and the sacrifice of
leisure. He explores why people engage in labor despite its inherent disutility, proposing that labor involves delayed
gratification: individuals endure the negative aspects of work to enjoy the benefits of leisure later.

## Edith Stein (1891–1942)

Edith Stein's perspective enriches our understanding of work through the lens of gender and vocation. She integrates
concepts of nature, freedom, and grace into her view of work. For Stein, while work is influenced by one's nature,
including gender, it is not solely determined by it. She emphasizes the personal nature of vocation and the role of
freedom in choosing one’s path. Stein also explores how grace sanctifies work and supports individuals through its
trials and triumphs. This chapter will first address her views on women's nature and education, then her ideas on
freedom and choice in vocations, and finally, how grace and spiritual practices enhance the experience of work.

## Michael Oakeshott (1901–1990)

Michael Oakeshott's concept of "the deadliness of doing" offers a critical perspective on the role of practical
activity, including labor, in human life. Oakeshott suggests that practical activities should not dominate our lives but
rather be complemented by philosophical and poetic endeavors. This chapter will explore:

Oakeshott's view on the limited role of practical activity, contrasting it with materialist perspectives like those of Karl Marx.

His belief that activities done for their own sake, rather than for external benefits, mirror the creative structure of
human experience. This section will compare Oakeshott’s views with those of Aristotle and Montaigne.
The role of ritualistic practices in achieving necessary practical outcomes in a less burdensome manner, highlighting
how rituals can be performed for their own sake while providing residual practical benefits.

## Josef Pieper (1904–1997)

Ferenc Hörcher examines Josef Pieper’s concept of leisure (*Musse*) as a counterpoint to Max Weber’s work ethic. While
Weber emphasized the Protestant virtue of diligence, Pieper, from a Catholic perspective, returns to medieval Christian
notions of contemplation. Pieper argues that human beings can achieve more than mere existential sustenance through work
by periodically withdrawing from the labor world to engage in spiritual and intellectual reflection. This chapter will
also critique modern work ideologies and their simplification of existence, aligning with Ortega's criticism of the
"revolt of the masses," and will explore the positive aspects of leisure, including play and culture.

## Hannah Arendt (1906–1975)

Hannah Arendt, a profound twentieth-century thinker, examined the human condition through the lens of work and activity.
Her work, notably *The Human Condition* (1958), distinguishes between labor, work, and action, offering a framework for
understanding these facets of human effort. This chapter will overview Arendt's categories and their impact on various
fields, including sociology and management studies. It also address critiques of her work, particularly from
feminist and democratic theorists.

## Alasdair MacIntyre (1929–)

Alasdair MacIntyre's moral philosophy, particularly his concepts of practices and practical rationality, is relevant to
discussions of work. Introduced in *After Virtue* and further developed in *Dependent Rational Animals*, MacIntyre defines
practices as cooperative activities with inherent goods and standards. He explores how practices help individuals
develop virtues and practical reasoning by distinguishing between immediate and long-term goods. This chapter will
analyze how MacIntyre's ideas on practices and desire transformation contribute to our understanding of work.

## New Natural Law Theory

The New Natural Law Theory (NNLT), advanced by philosophers like Germain Grisez, John Finnis, and Joseph Boyle,
reinterprets the principles of natural law based on practical reason rather than human nature. This chapter will outline
NNLT's account of the role of work as a fundamental good and its implications for practical reasoning and moral action.
It will also situate NNLT's perspective within a broader theological context.

## Raymond Geuss (1946–)

Gülşen Seven's chapter utilizes Raymond Geuss’s *A Philosopher Looks at Work* to explore contemporary issues and research
directions in the philosophy of work. It will examine traditional conceptions of work, including its definition,
organization, and societal value, and address anomalies and ideological features. The chapter will also engage with
recent works by David Graeber and Axel Honneth, comparing their views with Geuss’s.
