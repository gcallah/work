# Introduction

Gene Callahan, New York University

The genesis for this project was reading the material on work 
from Karl Löwith's *From Hegel to Nietzsche*
and being struck by how divergent the
views of work were even on one continent (and mostly from one country!)
during the course of one century.  I gradually began
collecting snippets of writings about work from over the centuries, and thought
it would be useful to explore however variously it has been conceived by
different major thinkers. These conceptions run the gamut from viewing work as
positively opposed to living the best life, to seeing it as the most essential
part of living the best life.

How did this almost schizophrenic view of work come about? And how did various
thinkers defend their positive or negative evaluations of work?

These questions are vital to contemporary liberalism, and to its critics, as a
vital issue dividing liberals from their critics -- Marxist, distributist,
post-liberal, etc. -- is the role of work in human life.


## The New Testament

The New Testament of the Bible launched into the Western world an entirely new concept of 'work': it was no longer the
arduous thing that the Hellenic philosophers had wanted to avoid, nor was it merely the Hebraic God's creative act or
the Jewish observance of the law: it was now God's saving act. God's work made man's work of only secondary
significance. Everyone is familiar with the Pauline and Lutheran doctrine of a distinction between 'justification by
faith' and 'justification by works'. But no such distinction is possible when we consider the full range of meanings of
work in the New Testament. There are many words for 'work' in the New Testament: not only ergon, work in the sense of
effective act, but also kopos, work in the sense of burdensome act, and ponos, work in the sense of painful act; and not
only these still relatively straightforward terms, but also the related and importantly contrasted words praxis and
poiesis (the origins of our words for 'practice' and 'poetry') and words for specific and significant works: healings,
miracles, signs, even resurrection. Work is no simply category in the Bible, and cannot be: because there is a continual
leaping over of the levels from earthly to heavenly. Therefore, the New Testament contains much matter about ordinary
work, in the sense of toil, but also discusses the messianic and apostolic work of healing and preaching, and, finally,
it recognises the work of God the Father in the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. By 'faith' the Christian
tradition did not disparage work: on the contrary, it asked Christians to trust in work, the work of God.


## Francis Bacon

Nature, in the modern imaginary, is an obstacle to human well-being and is therefore the subject of human power and
technological innovation. Francis Bacon (1561-1626) was a principal architect of this modern understanding of nature.
This chapter will pay special attention to one element that played a particularly important role in how Bacon came to
understand nature's resistance to human concerns, on the one hand, and the way in which something could be done about
it: the Judeo-Christian concept of the fall of man (as chronicled in Genesis 3).

When we pay close attention to Bacon's historico-theological framing device of the fall of man, we see that the
central problem of human existence is the fact that man has lost his dominion over nature such that work, and not
rest, is his constant mode. Men must work to toil the ground and are in constant search for labour-saving devices to
reduce the amount of work required to satisfy their material needs. To make matters worse, the dominant approach to
natural inquiry has proved unable to produce technological fruit. However, if there were a method of natural inquiry
that could more effectively enable us to manipulate nature for our benefit, we might be able to enter into God's
sabbath rest, for which we were originally created. This, I shall attempt to argue, is Bacon's view.



## Hegel

Hegel's daunting complexity and abstraction can obscure that labor—engagement with the physical, material world—plays a
critical role in the development of the self-conscious individual and of the rational state. Indeed, as vociferous a
critic as Marx observes (albeit critically) in the 1844 Manuscripts that Hegel "grasps labor as the essence of man."
Without embracing Marx's totalizing claim, this chapter aims to highlight the importance of labor to Hegelian philosophy
by focusing on two major texts. This task requires treating labor's crucial but often underappreciated role in the
Phenomenology of Spirit before turning to some more familiar passages on labor in the Philosophy of Right.  The chapter
will proceed in the following manner. We will first examine the Phenomenology to see how labor functions as a foundation
for human self-consciousness before proceeding to an analysis of its role in the mature political philosophy of the
Philosophy of Right. There, we shall see Hegel's analysis of a labor both embedded in civil society and under threat
from the market.

## Arendt

Rebel, refugee, and political thinker, Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) is
renowned for grappling with grave themes. She attempted to make sense of
the horrors of the twentieth century and to understand the human
experience in the context of modernity. Because she centered this
exposition on how we approach work and activity, rather than our traits
and dispositions, her schema for understanding what it means to be human
is especially relevant to the aims of this volume. Arendt's framework
for thinking about something typically considered quotidian---the human
experience of work---has been impactful, generating attention in fields
as diverse as sociology, occupational science, and management
studies.[^1] These days, scholars and pundits look to Arendt to reckon
with various socio-political ills, such as "the decline of liberal
democracy, the spread of fake news, the rise of the social sphere, the
triumph of technology, the loss of the private realm and the experience
of mass loneliness."[^2] Her work is not above reproach, however, as
feminists and democratic theorists alike have criticized aspects of her
oeuvre.[^3]

Posited in her treatise *The Human Condition* (1958), her distinctions
between labor, work, and action offer a typology of the human effort we
call work. This chapter provides an overview of Arendt's categories of


## Oakeshott

In this titular poetic Oakeshottian phrase is contained a view of human life which does not prioritize practical
existence (including labor), but rather employs poetic imagining and philosophical exploration as ways of superseding it
without negating it ("the splendors of the firmament of time may be eclipsed but are extinguished not"). This essay
explores the relevance of Oakeshott's arresting phrase, "the deadliness of doing,"1 to the theme of this edited volume
on the place of labor in a human life. The steps in this exploration include:

(1) Oakeshott's view of the limited place of all practical activity in a human life, distinguished from the view, for
example, of a materialist philosopher such as Karl Marx that all human thought and abstraction is derivative from
practical considerations;

(2) Oakeshott's view that the most intelligent approach to human satisfaction is to nurture a life which as much as
possible engages in activity which can be done largely for its own sake, rather than for some other, external benefit;
that this is an intelligent approach to living because it mirrors the structure of human experience which is creative or
poetic rather than prosaic; and how Oakeshott's view on the meaning of activity done for its own sake compares and
contrasts with the views of Aristotle and Montaigne (one of Oakeshott's "heroes");

(3) a discussion of the importance of ritualistic practices as an intelligent approach to achieving necessary and
unavoidable practical outcomes in a less burdensome (and less "deadly") fashion, since rituals arguably are practices
most amendable to being performed for their own sake, while also yielding some residual practical benefits;
