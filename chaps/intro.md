# Introduction

Gene Callahan, New York University

The genesis for this project was reading the material on work 
from Karl Löwith's *From Hegel to Nietzsche*
and being struck by how divergent the
views of work were even on one continent (and mostly from one country!)
during the course of one century.  I gradually began
collecting snippets of writings about work from over the centuries, and thought
it would be useful to explore how variously it has been conceived by
different major thinkers. These conceptions run the gamut from viewing work as
positively opposed to living the best life, to seeing it as the most essential
part of living the best life.

How did this almost schizophrenic view of work come about? And how did various
thinkers defend their positive or negative evaluations of work?

## Plato (427-348) and Aristotle (384-322)

James Murphy tells us that the puzzle at the heart of Plato and Aristotle's appraisal of work is that they both combine high praise for
craftsmanship with frequent denigration of craftsmen. W.B. Yeats wondered "how can we know the dancer from the dance?"
We might ask how Plato and Aristotle distinguish craftsmanship from craftsmen and why they honor the first and disparage
the second. Both thinkers exclude craftsmen from citizenship, and yet Plato calls his philosophical rulers "the best
possible craftsmen" and he calls ruling "the royal craft."

Both thinkers praise the knowledge required for skillful work but disparage the manual skill and sheer toil of human
labor; they praise those who conceptualize the task but disparage those who merely execute it. As such, their appraisals
reflect their own views of the greater dignity of intellectual over physical activity, preventing them from seeing that
the knowledge of craftsmen cannot be separated from their manual skills, and that craft knowledge can be acquired only
through the body. Craftsmanship is the unity of conception and execution, mind and hand.


## The New Testament

The New Testament of the Bible launched into the Western world an entirely new concept of 'work': it was no longer the
arduous thing that the Hellenic philosophers had wanted to avoid, nor was it merely the Hebraic God's creative act or
the Jewish observance of the law: it was now God's saving act. God's work made man's work of only secondary
significance. Everyone is familiar with the Pauline and Lutheran doctrine of a distinction between 'justification by
faith' and 'justification by works'. But no such distinction is possible when we consider the full range of meanings of
work in the New Testament. There are many words for 'work' in the New Testament: not only ergon, work in the sense of
effective act, but also kopos, work in the sense of burdensome act, and ponos, work in the sense of painful act; and not
only these still relatively straightforward terms, but also the related and importantly contrasted words praxis and
poiesis (the origins of our words for 'practice' and 'poetry') and words for specific and significant works: healings,
miracles, signs, even resurrection. Work is no simply category in the Bible, and cannot be: because there is a continual
leaping over of the levels from earthly to heavenly. Therefore, the New Testament contains much matter about ordinary
work, in the sense of toil, but also discusses the messianic and apostolic work of healing and preaching, and, finally,
it recognises the work of God the Father in the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. By 'faith' the Christian
tradition did not disparage work: on the contrary, it asked Christians to trust in work, the work of God.


## Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274)

It would be a gross exaggeration to say that the topic of work was a central concern for Aquinas. He first discussed it
as part of the defense of those religious orders that no longer sustained themselves by manual labor, while his most
frequently cited text was a Quodlibet, a question posed to him at a public dispute and not chosen by him for its
inherent importance. Even though the argument of these early works were further developed in his later theological
summaries, their point of departure always remained the same question ("whether it was obligatory for the members of a
religious order to do manual work"). A more overarching "Thomistic theory of work" is thus something to be reconstructed
from these scattered references and not a doctrine he laid out in a fully-fledged form.

The reason why it is nevertheless worth dealing with Aquinas is that many modern authors do the same, mostly in the
field of economics. Some of them suggest that he was a forerunner of Adam Smith on the division of labor, or even of
Marx on the labor theory of value; while others maintain that he promoted a more "humane" economy than ours, making him
an avant la lettre critic of capitalism.  While all these accounts testify to the enduring influence of Aquinas, they
are also to some extent mistaken, for his main concern was theological, or rather soteriological (connected to the
salvation of the human being), and not strictly speaking social or economic. To understand his point, it will thus be
necessary to have recourse to the original texts, preceded by a brief overview of their terminology and historical
context.

## Martin Luther (1483-1546)

In 1530, in Wittenberg, Luther held a mid-week sermon series (lectio continua) on the Sermon on the Mount,  including
the Beatitudes, the sixth statement of which reads as follows: "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God."
(Mt 5:8) But who are the pure in heart who will see God? Luther's commentary confused his audience just as much as it
does today's readers because it goes against the natural way of thinking; according to which, a person with a pure heart
is one who can keep himself away from the world's filth and can live a contemplative life, during which only divine
things occupy his attention. Contrasting the filthy world and pure spirituality was as natural in the 16th century as it
is in the early 21st century - even if for partly different reasons. Contrary to it, Luther tells the citizens of
Wittenberg the following: the only thing that can be achieved with a contemplative life away from the world is that the
heart becomes impure; the person falls into ungodliness because he is driven by his own – as Luther explains it –
imaginations and dreams. If someone wants to be pure in heart, he can achieve it not by turning away from, but by
turning towards the world, by living in it. Luther takes this so seriously that the blacksmith and the cobbler who reek
of tar and pitch, and the servant who walks in filth up to his neck and even shovels dung become the paradigm of a
pure-hearted person for him. Does the smell of these manual laborers repel us? As it turns out, they are the
pure-hearted ones.  In my study, I investigate this surprise and ask: How can the dung-shovelling maid become the
paradigm of a believer for Luther?

## Francis Bacon (1561-1626)

Nature, in the modern imaginary, is an obstacle to human well-being and is therefore the subject of human power and
technological innovation. Francis Bacon (1561-1626) was a principal architect of this modern understanding of nature.
This chapter will pay special attention to one element that played a particularly important role in how Bacon came to
understand nature's resistance to human concerns, on the one hand, and the way in which something could be done about
it: the Judeo-Christian concept of the fall of man (as chronicled in Genesis 3).

When we pay close attention to Bacon's historico-theological framing device of the fall of man, we see that the central
problem of human existence is the fact that man has lost his dominion over nature such that work, and not rest, is his
constant mode. Men must work to toil the ground and are in constant search for labor-saving devices to reduce the amount
of work required to satisfy their material needs. To make matters worse, the dominant approach to natural inquiry has
proved unable to produce technological fruit. However, if there were a method of natural inquiry that could more
effectively enable us to manipulate nature for our benefit, we might be able to enter into God's sabbath rest, for which
we were originally created. This, I shall attempt to argue, is Bacon's view.



## Adam Smith (1723-1790)

Adam Smith was a Scottish thinker, professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Glasgow, a custom officer, and
generally considered the father of economics because of his *An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of
Nations*. 

After the invisible hand, the division of labor is probably the most common idea associated with Adam Smith. Both
concepts have been used and abused in many different forms. According to Paganelli, Smith thought the division of labor
to be of crucial importance for creating a prosperous and happy society.



## Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831)

Hegel's daunting complexity and abstraction can obscure that labor -- engagement with the physical, material world -- plays a
critical role in the development of the self-conscious individual and of the rational state. Indeed, as vociferous a
critic as Marx observes (albeit critically) in the 1844 Manuscripts that Hegel "grasps labor as the essence of man."
Without embracing Marx's totalizing claim, this chapter aims to highlight the importance of labor to Hegelian philosophy
by focusing on two major texts. This task requires treating labor's crucial but often underappreciated role in the
Phenomenology of Spirit before turning to some more familiar passages on labor in the Philosophy of Right.  The chapter
will proceed in the following manner. We will first examine the Phenomenology to see how labor functions as a foundation
for human self-consciousness before proceeding to an analysis of its role in the mature political philosophy of the
Philosophy of Right. There, we shall see Hegel's analysis of a labor both embedded in civil society and under threat
from the market.

## Soren Kierkegaard (1813-1855)

Soren Kierkegaard's writings contain little direct commentary on labor, or, indeed, economics in general.
So why include him at all in a volume about work?
It is because insights into the character of the person who labors. Kierkegaard's writings present a
Christian view of labor as part of one's spiritual vocation. He proclaims that there is a distinct calling for each life,
and that despite earthly differences of status, all are persons are equal before God as they pursue their callings.

## Giovanni Gentile (1875-1944)

Considered by some to be the most prominent Italian philosopher of the twentieth century, Giovanni Gentile (1875-1944)
organically fulfilled the "humanism of labor" in his work-testament, *Genesis and Structure of Society* (published
posthumously in 1946). Gentile believed that the modern world had come to understand the spiritual value of labor in the
same way that he had understood the spiritual value of culture. He recognized the "sense" of intellectual and manual
labor as having a methodological and crucial significance because of its unbreakable connection to the "Absolute
Spirit," which enables understanding of the formative significance of working action. Gentile's thesis emphasizes the
significance of the interaction between "intellectuals" and "workers" in the framework of human values, identifying a
real union of labor and culture.

## Max Weber (1864-1920)

In his most renowned book, *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism*, Max Weber famously
explained the rise of "modern capitalism" as partially due to the "Protestant ethic," which, he claimed, was a new
attitude towards work and towards capital accumulation. (It is the former aspect, of course, that justifies examing the
book in a volume devoted to thoughts about work.) But while this thesis is (in)famous, it has often been dismissed,
sometimes as a nice attempt that on examination failed, and at other times as simply preposterous.

In his paper, Callahan offers a summary of some highlights of the debate on Weber's thesis, with the goal of
indicating whether that it is still viable. In the course of doing so, it will become apparent that in many prominent
cases, as Stephen Kallberg argues in the introduction to his translation of PE, "Weber's critics never mastered his
complex argument."


## Ludwig von Mises (1881-1973)

"Well, a bad day of fishing is better than a good day at work," jokes the wise fisherman. This whimsical thought tells
us more than we might initially think. It reflects the individual's everyman view of the relationship between labor and
leisure. This turbulent but necessary relationship is a central point in the study of human action, where man engages in
a grueling and uncomfortable labor process to enjoy the eventual benefits of a full day of fishing and drinking.

The relationship between leisure and labor propelled many historical ideas, including the works of several prominent
socialists. Karl Kautsky, a well-known socialist thinker in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, recognized the pain
often involved in the laborious process. However, Kautsky asserted that the disutility of labor was an inherent issue of
capitalism, and a socialist revolution would need to transform labor from pain into pleasure. In contrast, the Austrian
economist Ludwig Von Mises argues against Kautsky's claims in his book Human Action, stating that Kautsky incorrectly
based his belief that socialism can transform labor's pain into pleasure on a misinterpretation of what characterizes an
activity as work.  According to Mises, labor creates disutility as long as the worker engages in the laborious process
as a means to attain a specific end. Hence, work is inherently unpleasant, creating a loss of utility due to discomfort
and foregone leisure utility.

The puzzle seems clear: if we examine the laborious process purely in terms of utility, why do individuals constantly
engage in work activities deemed to reduce utility? A simple answer is that labor involves delayed gratification; man
endures the negative utility of working only to enjoy the utility of leisure later. Mises noticed this curious
relationship between labor and leisure and attempted to elucidate what seems to be a polarizing relationship. 


## Edith Stein (1891-1942)

The category of "women's work" enriches a thorough intellectual history of the idea of work. Contributing this
perspective, this chapter explores the writings of philosopher and saint Edith Stein. Her understanding of vocation
integrated elements of "[n]ature, freedom, and grace."  This meant that while a person's work depends on the (sexed)
nature of the person, gender roles are not the simple answer to organizing work. Indeed, "vocation is also something
personal," and "the specific nature of the individual must be considered."  Thus, freedom enters the equation, before
finally, the grace of God sanctifies and encourages the trials and triumphs of work. This chapter proceeds according to
this three-part understanding. 

Because, for Stein, nature was a determinant in defining the work of women, Stein on woman's nature and her
corresponding views on girls' education are examined first. Next, this chapter turns to the category of freedom, which
informs Stein's exploration of women's vocations and professions, which, according to Stein, are tied to natural
tendencies, but preferences, temperament, and choice are also factors. A final, shorter section addresses how Stein saw
grace, prayer, and sacraments as fortifying work. The chapter concludes by linking the theme of women's work to one of
Stein's other intellectual interests – the phenomenology of empathy. 


## Michael Oakeshott (1901-1990)

In the Oakeshottian phrase "the deadliness of doing" is contained a view of human life which does not prioritize practical
existence (including labor), but rather employs poetic imagining and philosophical exploration as ways of superseding it
without negating it ("the splendors of the firmament of time may be eclipsed but are extinguished not"). This essay
explores the relevance of Oakeshott's arresting phrase, "the deadliness of doing,"1 to the theme of this edited volume
on the place of labor in a human life. The steps in this exploration include:

(1) Oakeshott's view of the limited place of all practical activity in a human life, distinguished from the view, for
example, of a materialist philosopher such as Karl Marx that all human thought and abstraction is derivative from
practical considerations;

(2) Oakeshott's view that the most intelligent approach to human satisfaction is to nurture a life which as much as
possible engages in activity which can be done largely for its own sake, rather than for some other, external benefit;
that this is an intelligent approach to living because it mirrors the structure of human experience which is creative or
poetic rather than prosaic; and how Oakeshott's view on the meaning of activity done for its own sake compares and
contrasts with the views of Aristotle and Montaigne (one of Oakeshott's "heroes");

(3) a discussion of the importance of ritualistic practices as an intelligent approach to achieving necessary and
unavoidable practical outcomes in a less burdensome (and less "deadly") fashion, since rituals arguably are practices
most amendable to being performed for their own sake, while also yielding some residual practical benefits; 

## Hannah Arendt (1906-1975)

Rebel, refugee, and political thinker, Hannah Arendt is
renowned for grappling with grave themes. She attempted to make sense of
the horrors of the twentieth century and to understand the human
experience in the context of modernity. Because she centered this
exposition on how we approach work and activity, rather than our traits
and dispositions, her schema for understanding what it means to be human
is especially relevant to the aims of this volume. Arendt's framework
for thinking about something typically considered quotidian---the human
experience of work---has been impactful, generating attention in fields
as diverse as sociology, occupational science, and management
studies.[^1] These days, scholars and pundits look to Arendt to reckon
with various socio-political ills, such as "the decline of liberal
democracy, the spread of fake news, the rise of the social sphere, the
triumph of technology, the loss of the private realm and the experience
of mass loneliness."[^2] Her work is not above reproach, however, as
feminists and democratic theorists alike have criticized aspects of her
oeuvre.[^3]

Posited in her treatise *The Human Condition* (1958), her distinctions
between labor, work, and action offer a typology of the human effort we
call work. This chapter provides an overview of Arendt's categories of


## Alasdair MacIntyre (1929-)

Two aspects of MacIntyre's moral philosophy are relevant to his reflections on work: the notion of practices and the
idea that our practical rationality is developed as we learn to educate and transform our desires. The first notion was
introduced by MacIntyre in *After Virtue* when he was trying to develop a sociologically grounded account of Aristotelian
ethics. The second idea, although present in most of MacIntyre's work, emerges more prominently with the publication of
*Dependent Rational Animals*.

Practices, in the MacIntyrean sense of the term, are socially established and cooperative activities, with various
degrees of complexity, whereby agents pursue certain goods that are constitutive of those forms of activity. In this
context, agents are expected to gradually internalize and develop themselves those standards of excellence that are
required for the achievement of the goods 'internal' to that form of activity. Through this process agents extend or
develop their human potentialities and their understanding of the goods involved in whatever practice they find
themselves engaged in. Examples of practices include the arts and sciences, games like chess or basketball, the
activities of farming communities or fishing crews, and the making and sustaining of family life or schools.

How do practices educate and transform our desire?
MacIntyre accounts for this process by pointing to the relationship between desire and practical reasoning.  The
acquisition of the virtues is a process of moral development which MacIntyre describes as that whereby agents learn how
to distinguish between what is actually good for them from what they take to be good here and now. What agents learn in
this process is to evaluate their reasons for action according to what is good for them as members of their family,
workplace, or local political community. In MacIntyre's terminology, agents become 'independent practical reasoners'
when they can educate their desires by

## New Natural Law Theory

The "New" Natural Law Theory (NNLT) is a moral theory grounded in a reinterpretation of Saint Thomas Aquinas's
understanding of the first principles of the natural law, elaborated and defended over several decades initially by
Germain Grisez, John Finnis, and Joseph Boyle, and subsequently by many other philosophers and moral theologians.1 On
the "new" view, the first principles of practical reason, and hence of the natural law, are known self-evidently by
practical reason, and not by inference from truths about human nature. These first principles identify a number of basic
human goods as to-be-pursued, and the NNLT understands "morality" as a matter of being reasonable in pursuing the
various options for actions that these goods, identified more fully below in Section I, make possible.

NNLT provides a distinctive account of the role that the good of work plays among practical reason's foundations. In
this essay, Tollefsen identifies the NNLT account of the nature of and value of work. He then looks at some practical consequences
of the NNLT understanding of the good of work; and situates the NNLT understanding of work within a larger theological
context.
