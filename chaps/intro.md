# Introduction

Gene Callahan, New York University

In the *Book of Genesis*, as Adam and Eve are exiled from Eden, God tells them, "By the sweat of your brow you will eat
your food." Thus begins our long, difficult relationship with working: is it a curse we suffer under, or the very means
by which our lives find their purpose?

The genesis for this project was my reading the material on work 
in Karl Löwith's *From Hegel to Nietzsche*
and being struck by how divergent the views of work were even on one continent (and mostly from one country!)
during the course of one century.  I gradually began
collecting writings about work from other times and places, and decided
it would be useful to explore how variously it has been conceived by
different major thinkers. These conceptions run the gamut from viewing work as
positively opposed to living the best life, to seeing it as the most essential
part of living the best life.

Reflections on work are back in vogue, with recent notable works on the topic by Geuss, Graeber, Lucassen and Suzman,
among others.  Furthermore, the increasing role of automation replacing human physical labor, and now artificial
intelligence replacing even some human intellectual labor, the question of what place work holds in the human world is
more salient than ever.

How did the Western world's almost schizophrenic view of work come about? And how did various
thinkers defend their positive or negative evaluations of work? This volume was assembled in order to collect in one
place some of the thoughts of some of the most significant theorists of work in the Western tradition. Although we have
not been able to cover every thinker we wished to -- for instance, Augustine, Durkheim, and Veblen all would have had
their place in this volume, if it had been possible to solicit essays on them -- we have
been able to cover a significant sampling of the most important thinkers on this topic,
beginning 2400 years ago, with the founders of philosophy, who were decidedly in the "pro-leisure" camp.

## Plato (427–348 BCE) and Aristotle (384–322 BCE)

James Murphy highlights a fascinating paradox in Plato's and Aristotle's evaluation of work: both philosophers praise the
virtues of craftsmanship while simultaneously denigrating craftsmen. Murphy notes W.B. Yeats asking, "How can we know the dancer
from the dance?" A similar question arises regarding Plato and Aristotle: How do they differentiate between the act of
craftsmanship and the craftsmen themselves, and why do they admire the skill while dismissing those who possess it?

Neither philosopher considers craftsmen worthy of citizenship. Yet, Plato refers to his ideal rulers as "the best
possible craftsmen" and describes ruling as "the royal craft." They both admire the intellectual knowledge required for
skilled work but criticize the manual skill and labor involved. They celebrate those who conceptualize tasks but
have little regard for those who execute them. This perspective reflects their broader belief in the superior dignity of intellectual
over physical pursuits. As such, their writings are early milestones in the "anti-labor" pole of our dichotomous
understanding of work.

## The New Testament

James Alexander contends that
the New Testament transformed the view of work in Western thought. Unlike the arduous labor avoided by
Hellenic philosophers or the Hebraic notion of divine creation, work in the New Testament is redefined as God's saving
act. In this new context, human labor is seen as secondary to divine work, but still partaking of its essential
goodness.

While the Pauline and Lutheran doctrines distinguish between 'justification by faith' and 'justification by works,' such
a distinction is less clear when considering the full spectrum of work in the New Testament. Various terms for 'work'
appear: not only *ergon* (effective act), but also *kopos* (burdensome act) and *ponos* (painful act). Additionally, terms
like *praxis* and *poiesis* (the roots of 'practice' and 'poetry') and words denoting specific significant acts--such as
healings, miracles, signs, and resurrection--illustrate the complexity of the New Testament's contribution to our understanding
of work. Its view embraces both ordinary toil and the divine work of healing and preaching.
And it culminates in the salvific work of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.
In the end, the New Testament, while not dismissing the genuine value of work, emphasizes trust in God's work.

## Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

As Tamás Nyirkos notes,
work was not a primary focus in the writings of Thomas Aquinas. His discussions of the topic emerged in the context of
defending those religious orders that no longer engaged in manual labor, something that was controversial during his time.
The most frequently cited passage on this topic are
from a public disputation question in a *Quodlibet* (a public disputation question)
rather than from a treatise where he selected it for its intrinsic significance.
Though his early arguments were further developed in his theological summaries, they consistently involve the question of
whether those in religious orders were obligated to perform manual work.
Thus, a "Thomistic theory of work" must be pieced together from these dispersed references rather than
being given to us as a fully developed doctrine.

Despite this, Aquinas remains a significant figure in many modern discussions of work,
particularly in economics. Some scholars view
him as a precursor to Adam Smith's ideas on the division of labor or even Karl Marx's labor theory of value.
Others argue that he advocated for a more "humane" economy, critiquing capitalism before its time. Although these
interpretations reflect Aquinas's lasting influence, his primary interest in work was 
soteriological -- how work relates to human salvation -- rather than purely social or economic. 

To grasp his perspective, Nyirkos delves into his original texts, armed with
an understanding of their terminology and historical context.


## Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Orsolya Horváth begins her chapter on Luther with a specific episode in his life:
In 1530, Martin Luther delivered a mid-week sermon series in Wittenberg on the Sermon on the Mount, including the
Beatitudes.  Luther's interpretation of the sentence
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God" (Matthew 5:8).
particularly puzzled his audience.
Luther's of just who is "the pure in heart" challenges
conventional views, which often associate purity of heart with a life removed from worldly distractions, focusing solely
on divine contemplation.

In the 16th century there was a prevalent contrast between the corrupt world of everyday life and the ideal world
of pure spirituality. Luther rejects this dichotomy. He argues that a contemplative life, detached
from the world, only leads to impurity and ungodliness, as it fosters delusions and fantasies. Instead, Luther posits
that true purity of heart is achieved not by withdrawing from the world but by engaging with it. For him, the
blacksmith, the cobbler with tar-stained hands, and even the dung-shoveling servant embody the essence of purity. Horváth
explores the question of how a dung-shoveling maid can represent the ideal believer in Luther's view?

## Francis Bacon (1561–1626)

Tyler Chamberlain notes
that in modern thought, nature is often seen as an obstacle to human well-being, a hostile force requiring human
subjugation. Francis Bacon was a key figure in forwarding this understanding.
His chapter focuses on one crucial influence on Bacon's understanding of nature's
resistance and how it might be overcome, namely, Bacon's interpretation of the Judeo-Christian concept
of the fall of man, as described in Genesis 3.

Bacon's take on the fall posits the central human predicament as the loss of dominion over nature. According
to Bacon, this loss necessitates constant labor, as humanity must toil to meet its material needs. The prevailing
approach to understanding nature has, in his view, failed to yield practical technological advances. Bacon believed that
a more effective method of natural inquiry could potentially restore humanity's dominion and allow us to achieve the
divine rest for which we were originally created. Chamberlain contends that this is Bacon's vision.

## John Locke (1632–1704)

Jason Ferrell writes that
John Locke's theories on labor and property are well-explored, but they remain provocative. Traditionally, Locke is seen
as a natural law theorist who justifies property rights through labor, asserting that labor fulfills a moral duty of
self-preservation. Interpretations of Locke's work generally fall into three categories: one that aligns him with
classical liberalism and libertarianism; another that critiques him for justifying exploitative market practices; and a
third that dismisses his ideas as outdated. These interpretations often reflect the biases of individual scholars more
than Locke's actual arguments.

Despite the familiarity of Locke's work, Ferrell argues that there are important nuances that repay a fresh look.
Its continued relevance is evidenced by the fact that recent scholars, such as Robert Nozick, have turned to Locke for
inspiration.

## Adam Smith (1723–1790)

Adam Smith, a Scottish thinker and professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Glasgow, is widely regarded as the
father of economics, primarily due to his seminal work, *An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations*.

Maria Paganelli argues that, while 
the concept of the "invisible hand" is perhaps Smith's most famous idea, that of the division of
labor is also a key idea closely associated with Smith. According to Paganelli, Smith considered the division of labor
essential for creating a prosperous and happy society. Both concepts have been extensively interpreted and sometimes
misused, but they remain central to understanding Smith's economic thought.

## Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831)

William Lomabrdo explains that
Hegel's daunting and abstract philosophy often obscures the critical role that labor -- engagement with the physical 
material world -- plays in the development of the self-conscious individual and the rational state. Marx, in his *1844 Manuscripts*,
recognized this when he noted that Hegel "grasps labor as the essence of man.". Lombardo's chapter
explores labor's significant yet frequently overlooked role in Hegelian philosophy by examining two major texts.
He first analyzes its foundational role in Hegel's *Phenomenology of Spirit* and then explores its place in the
*Philosophy of Right*. His analysis reveals how Hegel portrays labor as both integral to human self-consciousness and
as a component embedded in civil society while under threat from market economies.

Lombardo further contends that Hegel's thoughts on labor are not merely of historical interest, but of contemporary
relevancy, especially when contemplating the impact of automation and artificial intelligence on the world of human
work.

## Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855)

Nathanael Blake's essay immediately raises the question, "Since Kierkegaard did not write about economics at all, why
include material on him in a volume on work?" He answers that, while 
Kierkegaard's writings rarely address labor or economics directly, his views on labor are relevant due to
his broader insights into the nature of personal vocation. Kierkegaard presents labor not merely as a mundane activity
but as a component of one's spiritual calling. He argues that every individual has a unique vocation and that despite
social differences, all individuals stand equal before God in their pursuit of this calling. As such, he comes to us as
a voice from the "pro-work" side of our civilizational debate.

## Giovanni Gentile (1875–1944)

Spartaco Pupo writes that
Giovanni Gentile, a leading Italian philosopher of the twentieth century, developed a "humanism of labor" in his
posthumously published work, *Genesis and Structure of Society* (1946). Gentile believed that the modern understanding of labor as
spiritually valuable was correct, and akin to his view of culture. He emphasized the profound connection between intellectual and manual
labor and the "Absolute Spirit," arguing that both types of labor are of crucial significance. Gentile's thesis
highlights the importance of the interaction between intellectuals and workers, positing a genuine union of labor and
culture within the framework of human values.

Pupo further notes that Gentile's work is unduly neglected in the English-speaking world, due to his fame being eclipsed
by his older contemporary Benedetto Croce, and because of an article published in English by his erstwhile follower, Guido De
Ruggiero, who accused Gentile of promoting "an abstruse and tiresome theology" full of "false rhetorical emotion."
Gentile argues for renewed attention to Gentile, since his "humanism of labor" shows us a way to break out of our prison
of "technism and consumerism."

## Max Weber (1864–1920)

In *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism*, Max Weber famously linked the rise of modern capitalism to the
"Protestant ethic," which he argued fostered a new attitude towards work and capital accumulation. Callahan
assesses the validity of Weber's thesis, which has been both influential and controversial. He summarizes key debates
surrounding Weber's argument and explores how critics, as Stephen Kallberg notes, often fail to fully grasp the
complexity of Weber's analysis.

The upshot of this chapter is that, while Weber was wrong or at least insufficiently attentive to historical detail in
some aspects of his famous work, his central thesis has certainly not been decisively refuted, and is still worthy of
our attention today, as we seek to understand how we arrived at our current situation.

## Ludwig von Mises (1881–1973)

Gabriel Benzecry and Nicholas Jensen defend the case Ludwig von Mises makes, that laboring inherently involves
"disutility." They claim that the adage "A bad day of fishing is better than a good day at work"
reflects a sginificant understanding of the relationship
between labor and leisure. This relationship is central to Mises's analysis in of labor in *Human Action*. Mises critiques
the socialist view (represented by Karl Kautsky), which suggests that socialism could transform the disutility of labor into
pleasure. According to Mises, labor is inherently unpleasant because it involves discomfort and the sacrifice of
leisure. He asks why people engage in labor despite its inherent disutility, proposing that labor involves delayed
gratification: individuals endure the negative aspects of work to enjoy the benefits of leisure later.

## Edith Stein (1891–1942)

Sarah J. Wilford contends that any history of work will be incomplete without an exploration of "women's work."
To that end, she examines the work of Edith Stein.
Stein integrates
the concepts of nature, freedom, and grace into her view of work. For Stein, while work is influenced by one's nature,
including gender, it is not solely determined by it. She emphasizes the personal nature of vocation and the role of
freedom in choosing one's path. Stein also explores how grace sanctifies work and supports individuals through their
trials and triumphs. Wilford's chapter first addresses Stein's views on women's nature and education, then her ideas on
freedom and choice in vocations, and finally, how grace and spiritual practices enhance the experience of work. Wilford
demonstrates that Stein offers us a "middle way" view of women's work, simultaneously arguing that women may excel at
and should not be barred from any profession, while recognizing that the nature of women *qua* women may incline women
on the whole more towards certain roles in society.

## Michael Oakeshott (1901–1990)

John Coats argues that 
Michael Oakeshott's concept of "the deadliness of doing" offers a critical perspective on the role of practical
activity, and in particular, labor, in human life. Oakeshott suggests that practical activities should not dominate our lives but
rather be complemented by philosophical and poetic endeavors. Coats examines Oakeshott's view on the limited role of
practical activity, contrasting it with materialist perspectives like those of Karl Marx.

Coats goes on to discuss
Oakeshott's belief that activities done for their own sake, rather than for external benefits, mirror the creative structure of
human experience. Coats compares Oakeshott's views with those of Aristotle and Montaigne.
And Coats looks at the role of ritualistic practices in achieving practical outcomes
in a less burdensome manner, highlighting how rituals can be performed for their own sake
while providing residual practical benefits.

## Josef Pieper (1904–1997)

Ferenc Hörcher examines Josef Pieper's concept of leisure (*Musse*) as a counterpoint to Max Weber's work ethic. While
Weber emphasized the Protestant virtue of diligence, Pieper, from a Catholic perspective, returns to medieval Christian
notions of contemplation. Pieper argues that human beings can achieve more than mere existential sustenance through work
by periodically withdrawing from the labor world to engage in spiritual and intellectual reflection. This chapter will
also critique modern work ideologies and their simplification of existence, aligning with Ortega's criticism of the
"revolt of the masses," and will explore the positive aspects of leisure, including play and culture.

## Hannah Arendt (1906–1975)

In this chapter, Josefina Araos Bralic and Sarah Wilford take up the work of the the profound twentieth-century thinker,
Hannah Arendt. They show how Arendt examined the human condition through the lens of work and activity.
Arendt's writings, notably *The Human Condition*, distinguish between labor, work, and action, offering a framework for
understanding these facets of human life. Since Arendt's differentiation of these three types of human activity is
novel, Bralic and Wilford explain why Arendt undertakes this division.

These days, scholars and pundits look to Arendt to reckon with various socio-political ills, such as "the decline of
liberal democracy, the spread of fake news, the rise of the social sphere, the triumph of technology, the loss of the
private realm and the experience of mass loneliness."

They also address critiques of Arendt's work, particularly from feminist and democratic theorists.

## Alasdair MacIntyre (1929–)

Matias Petersen claims that
Alasdair MacIntyre's moral philosophy, particularly his concepts of practices and practical rationality, is relevant to
discussions of work. Introduced in *After Virtue* and further developed in *Dependent Rational Animals*, MacIntyre defines
practices as cooperative activities with inherent goods and standards. He explores how practices help individuals
develop virtues and practical reasoning by distinguishing between immediate and long-term goods. MacIntyre further
demonstrates that all work has inherent implications for other areas of life, including the political. For example, work
that demands workers put in 70 or 80 hours a week (like many entry-level investment banking jobs, for instance) will
obviously have a disastrous impact on family formation.

MacIntyre demonstrates that our work can be an aid or a hindrance in the development of our practical reasoning.
Furthermore, our current politics and social science, focusing as they do on the satisfaction of
existing preferences (without asking where those preferences came from) tend to create work environments hostile to
excellence, focused only on short-term profits and substituting wage growth for healthy workplaces.

## New Natural Law Theory

Christopher Tollefsen explains that the New Natural Law Theory (NNLT), advanced by philosophers like Germain Grisez,
John Finnis, and Joseph Boyle, reinterprets the principles of natural law based on practical reason rather than human
nature. These principles drawn from practical reason identify a number of basic human goods that should be pursued.
The NNLT concept of "morality" is that one should pursue these goods in a reasonable manner.

Tollefsen's chapter outlines NNLT's account of the role of work as a fundamental good and its implications for
practical reasoning and moral action.  It will also situate NNLT's perspective within a broader theological context,
concluding our ability to work is a sign of our creation in the image of God, and forms the basis of our other rights
and duties.

## Raymond Geuss (1946–)

Gülşen Seven's chapter utilizes Raymond Geuss's *A Philosopher Looks at Work* to explore contemporary issues and research
directions in the philosophy of work. It will examine traditional conceptions of work, including its definition,
organization, and societal value, and address anomalies and ideological features. Her chapter also engages with
recent works by David Graeber and Axel Honneth, contrasting their views with Geuss's.

Seven sums up Geuss as concluding "that for the sake of preserving a habitable environment and continuing to live (at all or perhaps
comfortably) in conditions of permanent unemployment, we need to produce and consume less, and, in the absence of work
as we know it, discover ‘new’ ways of remaining meaningfully active."
