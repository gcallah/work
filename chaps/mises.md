**Mises: The Disutility of Labor**

*Gabriel F. Benzecry and Nicholas A. Jensen*

"Well, a bad day of fishing is better than a good day at work," jokes
the wise fisherman. This whimsical thought tells us more than we might
initially think. It reflects the individual's everyman view of the
relationship between labor and leisure. This turbulent but necessary
relationship is a central point in the study of human action, where man
engages in a grueling and uncomfortable labor process to enjoy the
eventual benefits of a full day of fishing and drinking.

The relationship between leisure and labor propelled many historical
ideas, including the works of several prominent socialists. Karl
Kautsky, a well-known socialist thinker in the late 19^th^ and early
20^th^ centuries, recognized the pain often involved in the laborious
process. However, Kautsky asserted that the disutility of labor was an
inherent issue of capitalism, and a socialist revolution would need to
transform labor from pain into pleasure. In contrast, the Austrian
economist Ludwig Von Mises argues against Kautsky's claims in his book
*Human Action*, stating that Kautsky incorrectly based his belief that
socialism can transform labor's pain into pleasure on a
misinterpretation of what characterizes an activity as work.[^1]
According to Mises, labor creates disutility as long as the worker
engages in the laborious process as a means to attain a specific end.
Hence, work is inherently unpleasant, creating a loss of utility due to
discomfort and foregone leisure utility.[^2]

The puzzle seems clear: if we examine the laborious process purely in
terms of utility, why do individuals constantly engage in work
activities deemed to reduce utility? A simple answer is that labor
involves delayed gratification; man endures the negative utility of
working only to enjoy the utility of leisure later. Mises noticed this
curious relationship between labor and leisure and attempted to
elucidate what seems to be a polarizing relationship. When working, a
man seemingly engages in a process that does not grant a positive
utility. Although many people do not enjoy the activity of working, they
still endure it as a means to achieve a determined end. Hence, in order
for an action to be considered labor, according to Mises, the individual
must perceive that activity as a means to an end.

In the following sections, we will examine Mises's definition of labor,
his conceptualization of the disutility of labor, and a few exceptions
that might overcome the disutility of labor. Finally, we will conclude
our thoughts in the last section.

The Nature of Labor {#the-nature-of-labor .TNR-section}
===================

While labor is initially perceived to be a standard concept, the idea of
human labor can easily be incorporated into activities that should not
be classified as labor. In *Human Action*, Mises defines human labor as
the "employment of the physiological functions and manifestations of
human life as a means."[^3] Labor is defined as a tool for attaining
specific human ends. Consequently, leisure is its polar opposite -- the
act of forgoing labor.[^4]

Labor is an inherently scarce resource since humans have a finite
quantity of energy; hence, "every unit of labor can only bring about a
limited effect."[^5] A consequence of the scarcity of labor is the
incapacity of individuals to attain every possible end or desire. Humans
must choose wisely how and for what ends they will employ their
physiological functions. Given its scarcity, workers need to economize
their physiological functions and only employ it where they find it
suitable for the attainment of an end. Such differences in abilities and
pursued ends lead to differences among the workers: People face
differences in their physiological function (e.g., their abilities) and
what they prioritize through their physiological function. Mises
describes this as the "work a certain individual can perform is more
suitable for some ends, less suitable for other ends, and altogether
unsuitable for still other ends." [^6]

For the sake of comparison, Mises describes a hypothetical world where
labor is abundant and thereby unconstrained by scarcity. In this world,
all material factors of production are completely employed -- including
the labor supply. Consequently, the employment of more labor would not
lead to an increase in output. As Mises points out, the wages offered by
the market in this scenario would be insufficient to financially sustain
an individual or their family. The price would be extremely low since an
abundant labor supply would exist. Like any other product, if widely
available and easily replaceable, all else being equal, the price of
that good will be lower than if it was not widely available.

In reality, our world is constrained by labor's inherent scarcity, among
other constraints. For instance, labor may not always be easily
replaceable or widely available. Just as workers exhibit differences in
physiological functions, workers' productivity also varies. Similarly,
Mises asserts there is an inherent inequality among the results of their
labor, which makes the results of any given laborer's work vary
significantly in terms of quality and quantity. Thus, it is unlikely
that any two workers will have the same level of productivity. Take Adam
Smith's pin factory as an example: A worker whose job is to straighten
the wire might have a different level of productivity than another
worker who performs the same job.

*The Disutility of Labor*

Initially, Mises's definition of labor may appear overly broad since it
is easy to think of examples where humans employ physiological functions
for the attainment of a specific end but would not necessarily be
considered work. Imagine a recreational tennis player who employs
physical effort as a means to attain the end of winning the match. Is
the activity of the tennis player considered human labor? Mises replied
to this point by using a similar analogy:

> Hunting game was and is for many people regular disutility-creating
> labor. But there are people for whom it is pure pleasure. In Europe
> amateur hunters buy from the owner of the hunting-ground the right to
> shoot a definite number of game of a definite type. The purchase of
> this right is separated from the price to be paid for the bag. If the
> two purchases are linked together, the price by far exceeds the prices
> that can be obtained on the market for the bag.[^7]

Here, Mises stresses two points. First, one of labor's defining
characteristics is that its byproducts result in disutility for the
worker. Second, he posits that the higher price paid to hunt is evidence
that these hunters obtain utility from hunting. Mises asserts that the
context and subjective preferences of people performing similar tasks
distinguish the purposeful actions as either labor or leisure, based on
differing ends.

For instance, fishing, like hunting, is practiced as both a hobby and
work. Fishermen who go at dawn to set up their nets in the margins of a
lake and return at sunset to sell their catches to provide for their
families are engaging in a functionally different activity from
fishermen who fish with friends during a hot summer weekend. The
difference lies simply in the idea that the two groups of fishermen
experience the disutility of labor with differing motivations. The
disutility of labor, like utility in general, depends on the
individuals' subjective utility.

By the concept of the disutility of labor, Mises means that there is an
uneasiness related to labor. That is, all else being equal, people value
leisure more than they value the expenditure of labor. Leisure, in that
sense, "is valued as a good and that labor is regarded as a burden."[^8]
Therefore, leisure or the attainment of leisure can be seen as an end of
purposeful behavior. If, on the one hand, leisure is considered an end
in itself, on the other hand, labor can be viewed as a means to an end.
Thus, when someone is working, "the worker gives up leisure and submits
to the disutility of labor in order to enjoy either the product or what
other people are ready to give him for it."[^9]

Mises argues that a worker only chooses to work "because he prefers the
proceeds he can earn by working to the disutility of labor and the
pleasures of leisure."[^10] Only leisure can provide immediate
gratification without the disutility of labor. Instead, "People trade
the disutility-bringing labor for the products of labor; labor is for
them a source of mediate gratification."[^11] Regarding individuals'
motivations, "People work because they want to reap the produce of
labor."[^12] Labor is simply a means to an end, not, in most cases, the
end itself.

It is important to note that Mises distinguishes between "Introversive
Labor and Extroversive Labor" but argues that "seen from the point of
view of economics, introversive labor is to be qualified as
consumption."[^13]Mises defines extroversive labor as labor where "he
prefers the proceeds he can earn by working to the disutility of labor
and the pleasures of leisure."[^14] By contrast, introversive labor "is
expended because the disutility of labor in itself -- and not its
product -- satisfies."[^15] Acts of service such as
religiously-motivated acts, climbing a mountain for the achievement
attained, or working toward self-improvement, Mises argues, all
constitute introversive labor. In the case where fishing is a
recreational activity, for instance, the disutility of fishing is part
of the consumption process. While those who fish for leisure could
purchase fish from the supermarket rather than endure the laborious
fishing process, they engage in introversive labor as a consumption
behavior.

In sum, Mises views extroversive labor as the only economically relevant
form of labor, and it is the type of labor most comparable to Kautsky's
argument. A logical implication of Mises's position is that if there is
some "labor" that creates pleasure instead of reducing it, if there is
some type of labor where there is no disutility of labor, no wage will
be awarded for that activity. In Mises's framework, extroversive labor
requires the activity to be an end, not a means to an end, which makes
bearing labor's immediate disutility worthwhile. Even if, as Kautsky
asserts, labor's pain is transformed into pleasure, it no longer
functions as labor in the economic sense but as a consumption-based
introversive labor. Hence, in reality, any such activity is not labor
*per se* but leisure.

No activity can simultaneously be labor and leisure in Mises's
framework. The functions of leisure and labor are separate in his mind
from the emotional relationship to (extroversive) labor. Thus, "The joy
of labor therefore can neither alleviate nor remove the disutility of
labor. Neither must the joy of labor be confused with the immediate
gratification provided by certain kinds of work. It is an attendant
phenomenon which proceeds either from labor's mediate gratification, the
produce or reward, or from some accessory circumstances."[^16] Mises
further argues that the joys of labor depend partially on ideological
factors, and these ideologies are interchangeable in the laborer's eyes:

> However, the joy of labor ... can be eliminated by ideological
> influences and be replaced by the tedium of labor. The worker begins
> to hate his work if he becomes convinced that what makes him submit to
> the disutility of labor is not his own higher valuation of the
> stipulated compensation, but merely an unfair social system. Deluded
> by the slogans of the socialist propagandists, he fails to realize
> that the disutility of labor is an inexorable fact of human
> conditions, something ultimately given that cannot be removed by
> devices or methods of social organization. He falls prey to the
> Marxian fallacy that in a socialist commonwealth work will arouse not
> pain but pleasure.[^17] [^18]

This argument illustrates that the ideological context does not
influence labor production or the disutility of labor since "people do
not work for the sake of labor's joy, but for the sake of the mediate
gratification... The joy of labor is no substitute for the mediate
gratification of labor."[^19]

Mises's argument applies equally to the case of the two groups of
fishermen. The first group is giving up leisure time and submitting to
the disutility of labor. That is, fishing is a burdensome activity they
engage in to attain a specific end -- in this case, their family's
survival. The fishermen bear the burden of waking up early, facing the
heat of a clear summer day's sun, the burden of the employment of
physical and mental energy into the labor-intensive activity of fixing
and placing the nets, steering the boat, and pulling the fish on board.
They endure this so that, after an entire day at the lake, they may sell
some fish at a local market to sustain their families. Fishing, in this
case, is simply a taxing process for eventually attaining the desired
end.

The second group of fishermen, however, practice a very similar
activity. They wake up early on the weekend and spend an entire day at
the lake. They do this so that they can return at the end of the day
with a few pictures, a catch, and some fishing stories. However, for
these fishermen, the entire fishing process only created enjoyment. Just
as "The mountain-climber does not want simply to reach the peak, he
wants to reach it by climbing..."[^20], the fishermen's disutility of
labor created pleasure and excitement and is linked to the experience.
The fishing weekend activity was an end in itself. The goal of the
activity was not to provide for their families or any other goal that
requires fishing as a means.

The same argument applies to the hunter. Someone who hunts for a living
engages in a different physical and mental activity from someone who
practices hunting as a sport. Suppose both hunters employ the same
number of calories in the activity, use the same rifle, camouflage, and
truck, and spend the same time of their day hunting. All else being
equal, the only difference between their externally identical activities
is that one serves as a means to an end. In contrast, the other serves
as an end, even if no physiological differences set them apart. Hence,
one hunter's actions lead to the disutility of labor, and the other
hunter's actions lead only to enjoyment and pleasure. The hunter who
hunts for a living engages in the laborious process, whereas the hunter
who hunts for fun engages in leisure since they are forgoing actual work
to enjoy a day of hunting.

Mises's position is highly connected to a marginalist, individualistic,
and subjectivist approach to economics. Nothing inherent in physical
activity defines economically relevant labor; an entire range of
activities requires a level of physical and mental effort from
individuals, but these efforts are not equally comparable. In practical
economic terms, what truly defines labor is the idea that the individual
perceives that action as a means, not an end. The disutility of labor
depends on each individual's rationalization of their action. That is,
if an individual perceives fishing as a means to attain an income, then
fishing is labor, and the individual is subjected to the disutility of
labor. However, if the individual perceives fishing as an end of itself,
then fishing is not labor but leisure.

*The Labor Utopia*

The misunderstanding of the disutility of labor phenomenon gave rise to
a common interpretation of working relations among socialist thinkers.
Socialist thinkers identified the poor working conditions created by the
Industrial Revolution as one of the primary factors driving the
discomfort of engaging in the laborious process. Kautsky argues that
Socialists sought to transform labor into

> ...a joy, so that it will be a pleasure to work, so that the laborer
> will go to his work with pleasure. To be sure that is not so simple a
> thing, but at least a beginning to it can be made by the proletariat
> at the beginning of its rule in that it will shorten the hours of
> labor. At the same time it will endeavor to make the place of labor
> more hygienic and friendly and to take from the labor process as much
> as possible its disagreeable repulsive side that the laborer will go
> to his work with pleasure.[^21]

Kautsky believed it is possible to transform the discomfort associated
with labor into joy. That is, by promoting better working conditions and
more labor regulations, the laborer will yield, on net, pleasure from
labor. Similarly, Engels claims that, in a socialist commonwealth,
"productive work, instead of a means of enslavement, becomes a means of
liberating people by offering each individual the opportunity to develop
and use all of their abilities, physical and mental, in all directions,
and in which it is so a burden becomes a pleasure."[^22] Mises cites
this as the "Marxian fallacy that in a socialist commonwealth work will
arouse not pain but pleasure."[^23]

Mises points out that it is a mistake to attribute the disutility of
labor exclusively to the capitalist system. Mises argues that the
disutility of labor is a phenomenon that is an inextricable part of
human nature. The idea that a more regulated economy overcomes the
disutility of labor ignores the root of the phenomenon.

> People have misinterpreted this fact grotesquely and have based on
> this misinterpretation fantastic plans for social reforms. One of the
> main dogmas of socialism is that labor has disutility only within the
> capitalist system of production, while under socialism it will be pure
> delight. We may disregard the effusions of the poor lunatic Charles
> Fourier. But Marxian "scientific" socialism does not differ in this
> point from the utopians. One of its foremost champions, Karl Kautsky,
> expressly declares that a chief task of a proletarian regime will be
> to transform labor from a pain into a pleasure.[^24]

Mises provides several reasons why it is impossible to disentangle the
disutility of labor from labor itself. First, limiting the hours of
labor does not change the phenomenon itself. Whether the laborer works
six or twelve hours per day, they will still face labor's disutility.
The foregone time spent laboring could be spent on more pleasurable
activities, regardless of whether the marginal disutility of labor
changes based on the hours worked.

In addition, Mises argues that this policy effectively increases labor's
scarcity and indirectly makes capital goods scarcer as well, which "may
entirely undo the potential rise in the marginal productivity of labor
as against the marginal productivity of capital goods."[^25] He states
that this shift originates in a capitalist system, not in spite of
exploitation:

> Capitalism, says Marx, unthinkingly repeating the fables of the
> eulogists of the Middle Ages, has an inevitable tendency to impoverish
> the workers more and more. The truth is that capitalism has poured a
> horn of plenty upon the masses of wage earners who frequently did all
> they could to sabotage the adoption of those innovations which render
> their life more agreeable...Capitalism, by raising the standard of
> living, changes the worker's valuation of leisure over time. Better
> supplied with the amenities of life as he is, he sooner reaches the
> point at which he looks upon any further increment in the disutility
> of labor as an evil which is no longer outweighed by the expected
> further increment in labor's mediate gratification... As far as the
> allegedly prolabor laws decreed measures which were not merely the
> ratification of changes already effected or the anticipation of
> changes to be expected in the immediate future, they hurt the material
> interests of the workers.[^26]

Mises argues that such limits on labor cannot decouple the inherent
trade-off between labor and leisure consumption. Since the enjoyment of
leisure depends on the standard of living and the amount of labor
exerted to reach said standard of living, a decrease in the marginal
productivity of labor from reducing labor's supply comes at the expense
of a decreased utility of leisure. There is still an opportunity cost to
forgoing additional labor or leisure. The government would effectively
be restricting the laborer's freedom to choose if the disutility of one
more hour of labor outweighs the delayed benefits of that same hour of
labor. As Mises points out, like any other economic phenomenon, labor
depends on the worker\'s subjective marginal utility, not solely on
whether the institutional setting is capitalist or socialist.

*Labor's Mental Perception*

Kautsky implicitly asserts that the disutility of labor is dependent
upon the setting. Similarly, Marx argues that labor's disutility is tied
to the alienation of labor, which occurs in a capitalist system:

> The worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth he produces, the
> more his production increases in power and size. The worker becomes an
> ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates.
> The *devaluation* of the world of men is in direct proportion to
> the *increasing value* of the world of things. Labor produces not only
> commodities; it produces itself and the worker as a *commodity* -- and
> this at the same rate at which it produces commodities in
> general.[^27]

While Mises argues that the division of labor increases the utility of
leisure over time, Marx argues that it increases labor's disutility by
alienation in a private property-driven capitalist system, stating that
"Labor's realization is its objectification. Under these economic
conditions this realization of labor appears as loss of realization for
the workers; objectification as loss of the object and bondage to it;
appropriation as estrangement, as alienation."[^28] Mises criticizes the
argument that Marx's ideology[^29] can explain labor's disutility
throughout human action, firstly on a logic-based approach, and Marxian
ideology:

> Marx had a solution at hand. Human reason, he asserted, is
> constitutionally unfitted to find truth. The logical structure of mind
> is different with various social classes. There is no such thing as a
> universally valid logic. What mind produces can never be anything but
> "ideology," that is in the Marxian terminology, a set of ideas
> disguising the selfish interests of the thinker's own social class.
> Hence, the "bourgeois" mind of the economists is utterly incapable of
> producing more than an apology for capitalism.[^30]

Mises further explains that the mental perception or 'ideology' of the
disutility of labor is altogether separate from Mises's conception of
the disutility of labor:[^31]

> No ideology, however impressively emphasized and taught, can affect
> the disutility of labor. It is impossible to remove or to alleviate it
> by persuasion or hypnotic suggestion. On the other hand it cannot be
> increased by words and doctrines. The disutility of labor is a
> phenomenon unconditionally given. The spontaneous and carefree
> discharge of one's own energies and vital functions in aimless freedom
> suits everybody better than the stern restraint of purposive
> effort.[^32]

Mises argues, "...it \[The disutility of labor\] cannot be increased by
words and doctrines. The disutility of labor is a phenomenon
unconditionally given."[^33] Instead, the disutility of labor is an
innate quality given by scarce human attention, resources, and time.
Marx's conception of labor is based on Hegel's work, which Hegel
describes as "desire held in check, it is vanishing *staved off*, or:
work *cultivates and educates...*"[^34] Mises argues that such Hegelian
premises are ill-suited to the conception of labor, and often the result
of misinterpretation.[^35]

Suppose Karl Kautsky's assertion is correct and that a socialist system
can transform labor from pain into pleasure.[^36] If that is the case,
the activity that people perform in his socialist utopia cannot be
considered labor, since it is not "the employment of their physiological
functions for the attainment of ends other than the mere exercise of
these functions. It is merely pleasure. It is an end in itself; it is
done for its own sake and does not render any further service."[^37] If,
and only if, an activity is being exercised to achieve an end, can this
activity be considered labor. Hence, if socialism transforms work into
pleasure, then work under a socialist system cannot become labor but
simple pleasure. The act of straightening the wire in a factory under a
socialist regime is an end of itself and not labor. Under an alternative
motive proposed by Mises, labor is undertaken so that the disutility of
labor *is* the source of satisfaction; it ceases to be economically
relevant and is more accurately categorized as a form of
consumption.[^38] Such activities create a disconnect between Kautsky's
and Mises's definitions of what activities constitute labor.
Nevertheless, these differences so far do not reflect the relationship
between labor and markets for goods and services.

In this sense, in this utopian socialist economy, labor would not exist,
and consequently, labor markets would be nonexistent. As Mises points
out, "people trade the disutility-bringing labor for the products of
labor."[^39] Therefore, if labor does not yield disutility, then people
cannot acquire the products of labor. Trade in this scenario ceases.
Furthermore, if labor does not bring disutility, it would become
abundant. Regardless of whether a laborer's mindset or ideology makes
labor more or less enjoyable, it cannot wholly remove the disutility of
labor since, "The joy and the tedium of labor are psychological
phenomena which influence neither the individual's subjective valuation
of the disutility and the mediate gratification of labor nor the price
paid for labor on the market."[^40]

Like any other service or good, if its supply increases, we will see a
decrease in its equilibrium price. Wages likely reflect this
relationship, as Mises asserts: "The eagerness of certain people to get
jobs which offer an opportunity for the enjoyment of these particular
satisfactions tends to lower wage rates in this field."[^41]
Nevertheless, a resulting decrease in the price of labor often does not
hold true since it ignores the fact that the demand for labor is also
affected by labor's proposed positive utility. All else being equal, in
a hypothetical world where suddenly every individual gains utility from
labor -- such as Kautsky's hypothetical socialist system -- there would
be an increase in the labor supply, thereby reducing wages in
equilibrium.

Opportunity cost and the law of diminishing marginal utility would still
grant compensation. Even in the hypothetical world where labor is
enjoyable, individuals are still subject to these economic principles.
Economizing man will need to allocate their time among different
activities, and they would still face diminishing marginal utility like
any other pleasurable activity. If labor gives positive utility and is
classified as consumption, the opportunity cost of foregoing other
consumption activities that give positive utility remains.

This hypothetical world is nothing more than that -- hypothetical. Labor
as a source of delayed gratification is a means to an end, not an end in
itself. While Mises asserts that people engage in labor for various
reasons, including labor for labor's sake, he argues that such
activities are only a subset of labor activities. They are not of
primary economic relevance. Transforming labor, as Kautsky suggests,
involves transforming labor into consumption or leisure, but it cannot
wholly negate the disutility of labor through physiological,
psychological, or institutional changes. Mises admits that some labor
can provide utility from its "joys and tediums."[^42] These are separate
from the disutility of labor, and in most cases, these motivations for
labor are more accurately described as consumption, whereas the
disutility of labor is most accurately applied to the cases where "He
may work because he prefers the proceeds he can earn by working to the
disutility of labor and the pleasures of leisure."[^43] Even without
these factors, Israel and Fegley observe that any labor activity's
opportunity cost involves foregoing leisure's utility.[^44] People
engage in the pain of labor -- or, at minimum, foregoing the consumption
of additional leisure -- in order that they may purchase other
activities, goods, and services.

Mises's descriptions of labor intertwine multiple rationales for the
causes of the disutility of labor, including psychological
perceptions,[^45] physiological costs,[^46] and the opportunity costs of
foregone consumption of leisure.[^47] These various sources of the
disutility of labor often intermix Mises's claims about the ways in
which socialist goals of eliminating labor's disutility are infeasible.
Other economists often similarly describe these factors of Labor's
disutility. For instance, Jevons defined labor as "any painful exertion
of mind or body undergone partly or wholly with a view to future
good."[^48] Despite this, even supposing that Kautsky's assertions are
correct in that some or all of the psychological and physiological
factors Mises describes could be reduced or even transformed into
positive utility under a socialist regime, labor's opportunity cost is
inescapable since every unit of labor incurred involves sacrificing some
amount of leisure consumption.

*The Creative Genius*

One notable exception to Mises's definition of labor is the creative
genius. Creative geniuses are "pioneers," people who discover and create
what was previously unknown to mankind. A creative genius does not
experience the phenomenon of the disutility of labor. According to
Mises: "The activities of these prodigious men cannot be fully subsumed
under the praxeological concept of labor. They are not labor because
they are for the genius, not means but ends in themselves."[^49]

For example, consider Michelangelo's process of creating the *fresco*
"The Creation of Adam" in the Sistine Chapel. During the creative
process, Michelangelo does not face disutility since the task of
creating the *fresco* is not a means to an end but an end itself. The
artists are not necessarily searching for financial value as
compensation for their work (even though many get compensated) but in
search of aesthetic value.[^50]

Curiously, sometimes, artists ended up indirectly profiting in the
search for aesthetic value. If the market values aesthetic value, then
the artist, by pursuing the creation of aesthetically pleasing
*frescos*, can profit from it. Nevertheless, though Michelangelo did not
face the disutility of labor, he also did not necessarily gain
gratification while completing his work. The process might have been
frustrating, but not in the same sense as a regular laborious process.

> It is, furthermore, impossible to substitute other people's work for
> that of the creators. If Dante and Beethoven had not existed, one
> would not have been in a position to produce the *Divina Commedia*
> \[italics in original\] or the Ninth Symphony by assigning other men
> to these tasks. Neither society nor single individuals can
> substantially further the genius and his work.[^51]

A creative genius's work cannot be equivocated to a production result of
labor or leisure unambiguously in the same economic sense, Mises argues,
since the act of creation is the end rather than a means.[^52] The work
of the creative genius, their creation, remains one of the exceptions to
the phenomenon known as the disutility of labor.

*Conclusion*

Mises' understanding of the disutility of labor highlights the inherent
discomfort associated with work. Individuals inherently perceive labor
as a burden, which functions as a means rather than an end.[^53] This
disutility motivates people to work for future leisure or other rewards
until the marginal utility of additional labor is less than their
marginal disutility of labor. Regardless of the economic system, the
disutility of labor persists. 

Mises' analysis demonstrates that, despite improved working conditions,
labor remains a source of disutility due to the inherent nature of
real-world constraints such as time and physiological limitations. These
constraints conflict with socialists' claims that socialism would not
only remove the disutility of labor but turn it into an enjoyable
activity. Admittedly, there are exceptions to Mises's argument,
particularly the creative genius whose work surpasses the disutility of
typical labor due to intrinsic motivation and creative fulfillment.
However, his general criticisms of the socialist theories regarding
labor -- that the disutility of labor is unique to capitalism and that
socialism can convert the disutility of labor into positive utility for
workers -- are not convincingly refuted. While the environment may
contribute to the disutility of labor, Mises counters that there is no
socialist utopia that overcomes the problems of scarcity and opportunity
cost associated with labor.

While Mises acknowledges there are types of labor that provide fringe
benefits to laborers, these are an end in themselves, or a form of
consumption that does not wholly eliminate the disutility of labor.
Mises' praxeological framework emphasizes the subjective nature of labor
and its disutility, reinforcing the argument that a desire to maximize
utility ultimately motivates the laborious process with the expectation
of gaining leisure in the future.

[^31]: Ibid., 80 explains that the perception of being exploited by
    labor in a capitalist system is weakly based on Hegelian Dialectics
    but it lacks substantial support.

[^53]: Note that Ibid., 589 argues that attempting to influence
    laborers' perceptions so that they perceive labor as a benefit is
    "no substitute for the mediate gratification of labor." He argues
    further that joy or tedium associated with labor cannot overcome the
    disutility of labor, and that these factors are implicitly reflected
    in the price of labor.
