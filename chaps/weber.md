# The Protestant Hypothesis and the Spirit of Weber 

Gene Callahan

## Introduction

In his famous book, *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism* (henceforth *PE*),
Max Weber famously explained the rise of capitalism by pointing to the Protestant ethic, which, he claimed, was a new
attitude towards work and capital accumulation. A number of scholars have since disputed his explanation.

In this paper, I will attempt to offer a summary of some notable, recent debate on Weber's thesis, with the goal of
indicating whether that thesis is still viable. In the course of doing so, it will become apparent that in some
prominent cases, as Stephen Kallberg argues in the introduction to his translation of *PE*, "Weber's critics never
mastered his complex argument" (2011: 50).

Of necessity, this paper can only examine a small sample of those misinterpreting Weber. As Kallberg notes, quoting
Chalcraft, "Every year sees new contributions in various fields [of *PE* scholarship]
and it would undoubtedly take a lifetime to become
fully conversant with all the literature germane to PE" (2011: 57). Nevertheless, this sample will provide evidence that
the problem is as pervasive as Kallberg contends.

But before we turn our attention to Weber's thesis on the rise of capitalism, it will be helpful to visit his theory of ideal
types, as that is the setting in which *PE* must be viewed, in order to be properly understood.


## Weber's Theory of Ideal Types

Explain how Weber is doing ideal type history.

"The *ideal type* of the capitalist employer..." (93).

Lastly, I will note that history by invocation of ideal types has been criticized as "an unstable level of historical
understanding" (Oakeshott, 1999: 65): see Callahan (2007) for more on this point. It may be worth examining, in another
paper, to what extent this instability has contributed to the confusion over Weber's hypothesis.


## Weber's Thesis

Weber begins his work with an observation that raises a question: in Germany at that time (1905), 
Protestants held more high positions in industry than Catholics, even in places where Catholics are in the majority.
Here, he is acting as a proper "social detective": given a curious situation, let us search for an explanation.
Furthermore, Weber suspects that solving this mystery might help us understand the origins of capitalism.

He begins by evaluating several popular explanations of this discrepancy.

1. Historical circumstances: Wealthy towns wound up being Protestant.

2. Protestants were left freer, more indivualism.

But Puritanism led to a much stricter control of life than did Catholicism!

Catholic higher education tended to be in the humanities.

Protestant training--technical and managerial.

Weber does not hold that these are permanent tendencies – over time, other groups come to follow the "logic" of the capitalist economy as well.

Catholics in the minority have not followed Jews, Chinese into business success. Protestants have been successful even in majority.

Common view of ideals of religions – Catholic is ascetic, Protestant is worldly.

But this idea is contradicted by evidence- Pgs. 8-9

Pg. 11 -- the English: most pious and most commercial.

Pg. 13- the capitalist is an historical individual.

Pg. 14 – Weber is taking one standpoint amongst many.

Pg. 14-16- Franklin 

The duty of the industrialist is to increase his capital- this is an ethical maxim for Franklin.

Pg. 17- utility of virtue.

Pile up capital without enjoyment – sink into the grave under a great weight of goods!

A man diligent in business stands before kings.

Virtue and profession in a calling.

Duty in calling.

Pg. 19-20 -- In the present day, everyone must adapt to conditions.

Pg. 21 -- Franklin's spirit would have been condemned earlier.

Pg. 24 -- traditional amount of consumption.

Pg. 25 -- In the new attitude, labour is an end in itself.

Pg. 28 -- parvenus.

Pg. 29 -- life of the putter-out met traditional needs in a traditional manner.

Pg. 29-30 -- description of change.

Pg. 31 -- distrust of innovation.

Pg. 37 -- rational calculation became the basis of economic life.

Even Catholic capitalists thought their profession dangerous to salvation.

Give gifts to the Church to make up for making money.

Pg. 36- Marxist idea that ideas conform to the material base structure is nonsense here – much more materially developed
Florence and Venice were behind the backwoods of PA in regard to the development of capitalist attitudes.

Luther

A Calling -- vocation

--New Idea fulfilling one's worldly duties was the highest form of worldly activity.

The monastic life is a life of selfishness.

Labour in a calling expression of brotherly love.

But as Luther became more conservative, the calling came to be seen as accepting one's place in the current order.

Calvin

Calvinism is the strain of Protestantism that most promotes capitalism.

It is the combination of predestination – with worldly success as the sign of having been chosen -- and *disdain for consumption*
that leads to unlimited acquisition.


## The Critics

So what is Wrong with Weber's thesis, for those who rejected it completely or in part? As mentioned in the introduction,
no attempt will be made here to do an exhaustive survey; hopefully, however, it will be an interesting one.


### Acemoglu and Robinson

Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson, in their acclaimed book *Why Nations Fail* (2012),
reject Weber's theory for the following reason:

"What about Max Weber's Protestant ethic? Though it may be true that predominantly Protestant countries, such as the
Netherlands and England, were the first economic successes of the modern era, there is little relationship between
religion and economic success. France, a predominantly Catholic country, quickly mimicked the economic performance of
the Dutch and English in the nineteenth century, and Italy is as prosperous as any of these nations today. Looking
farther east, you'll see that none of the economic successes of East Asia have anything to do with any form of Christian
religion, so there is not much support for a special relationship between Protestantism and economic success there,
either." (60)

But in *PE*, Weber very explicitly states that, once the "spirit of capitalism" was *birthed* in
Protestant countries (for the reasons he explains), its material success would naturally result in its spreading to
non-Protestant areas: "Victorious capitalism, in any case, ever since it came to rest on a mechanical foundation, no
longer needs [Protestant] asceticism as a supporting pillar" (2011: 177).

So Weber had already offered an explanation for the facts that Acemoglu and Robinson suppose refute him.


### Braudel

Fernand Braudel's (1977) criticisms of Weber are both brief and insubstantial. He first states that "For Max Weber,
capitalism in the modern sense of the word was no more and no less than the creation of Protestantism, or, to be even
more accurate, of Puritanism" (65-66).

But what does Weber actually say on this point? Is modern capitalism the creation of a single factor? No, for Weber, it
is "a development that grew out of innumerable, fragmented historical forces" (2011: 108). In fact, Weber goes so far as
to state the idea that "capitalism as an *economic system* was a creation of the Reformation" is a "foolish
and doctrinaire" thesis (2011: 108). So Weber explicitly ridicules the very idea that Braudel claims to be his central
thesis!

"All historians have opposed this tenuous theory, although they have not managed to be rid of it once and for all. Yet it
is clearly false. The northern countries took over the place that earlier and so long and so brilliantly been occupied
by the old capitalist centers of the Mediterranean. They invented nothing, either in technology or in business
management." (66)

The problems here should, at this point, be obvious: Weber explicitly acknowledges the existence of large,
capital-intensive enteprises before the Protestant Reformation. And he made no claims about the northern countries
inventiveness. So although Braudel's assertion that the northern countries "invented nothing" seems absurd on
its face, it is will be neither necessary nor helpful to explore it here, since it has nothing to do with Weber's
thesis.

Braudel concludes his discussion of Weber by writing, "I believe Max Weber's error stems essentially from his
exaggeration of capitalism's role as promoter of the modern world" (67). It is hard to know what to make of this, for,
after all, Weber did not write a book called *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of the Modern World": he was exploring
the origin of capitalism, so naturally, his focus was on... capitalism. And this last claim does not even dovetail well
with Braudel's earlier one, which is that Weber simply got capitalism's origin story *wrong*: here it seems he just
placed too much emphasis on it!

### Campbell

Colin Campbell's under-appreciated *The Romantic Ethic and the Spirit of Modern Consumerism* is, in general,
complementary to Weber's book, in that Campbell largely accepts that Weber offers a good explanation for the origins of
the production side of ther modern economy; he sets out to do the same for the change that occurred in consumption.

Nevertheless, Campbell offers a minor criticism of Weber that is still worth addressing.
Noting that Weber's survey of Protestant thought essentially stops at around 1700, Campbell claims:

"This means that Weber's position must be taken to be one in which Protestantism as he outlined it constituted its
fully develop form, and that all that subsequently happened was a process of slow decline and decay in the face of the forces
of secularization and rationalization..." (165).

However, no, such thing "must be taken": all of that this shows is the Weber did not consider developments in
Protestantism after that time to be particularly relevant to his thesis. There simply is no implication that subsequent
developments were not important theologically or socially: Weber simply doesn't find them relevant for explaining the
*spirit of capitalism*.

### Becker

George Becker, in his paper "The Continuing Path of Distortion" (2009), implies that Weber had a partisan interest in
reaching the conclusions he did in *PE*:

"Weber's idealist interpretation of Offenbacher's school enrolment statistics provides a foremost
example of a scholarly claim with decided political overtones that are closely in line with Weber's and the liberal
Protestants' cultural agenda...
Weber's idealist interpretation of Offenbacher's data is also a statementof cultural criticism with partisan overtones
and decidedly political implications" (199-200).

I am not a mind reader, and certainly cannot read the mind of the long-gone Max Weber. But if what he was up to was
really a pitch for Protestantism, he did not make a very good job of it, to wit:

"Entirely realistically, the Catholic Church concluded that the human species was *not* an absolutely and clearly
determined unity to be valued as such" (2011:128).

Or:

"There was no mention [in Calvinism] of that genuinely humane cycle, followed by the Catholic, of sin, repentance,
pentinence, relief, and then further sin" (2011: 129).

Or, contrasting the Calvinist attitude towards sinners with the Catholic one:

"Hence, in light of his sinfulness, an attitude of compassionate helpfulness towards one's neighbor -- coming from an
awareness of one's own weakness -- could not be the appropriate response of the elect who, because chosen by the grace
of God, were saints. More suitable instead was a hatred and contempt for the sinner as an enemy of God..." (2011: 132-133).

If the above statements were intended by Weber as "partisan" endorsements of Protestantism as superior to Catholicism, I
would recommend against hiring him as a marketer.


### Tawney

In some ways, R.H. Tawney's 1926 work, *Religion and the Rise of Capitalism*, Is the most interesting of all the critics we
have examined. Tawney was writing a couple of decades after the original publication of *PE*, and much of his material
on Luther and Calvin strongly supports Weber's conclusions. A few quotes here should suffice to demonstrate this:

**On Luther and the idea of a calling:**

"The honest smith or shoemaker is a priest" (92).

**On the importance of Calvin:**

"No contrast could be more striking than that between [Luther's] social theory and the outlook
of Calvin. Calvin... accepted the main institutions of a commercial civilization, and supplied a creed to the classes
which were to dominate the future." (94)

"Calvin, and still more his later interpreters... [unlike Luther did not] regard with suspicion the mere fact of capitalist enterprise
in commerce and finance" (104).

**On this-wordly asceticism:**

"Monasticism was, so to speak, secularized" (98).

[Calvinism's] enemy is not the accumulation of riches, but their misuse for purposes of self-indulgence or
ostentation" (105).

**On good works in  Calvinism:**

"The aim is not personal salvation, but the glorification of God, to be sought... by
action -- the sanctification of the world by strife and labour... Good works are not a way of attaining  salvation, but
they are indispensable as a proof that salvation has been attained." (109)

**Calvinist values and economic success:**

"The very qualities which economic success demanded -- thrift, diligence, sobriety, frugality -- were themselves, after
all, the foundation... of the Christian virtues..." (110).

"[The Swiss reformers] See you start the attitudes cultivated by the life of business and affairs, stamped on them a
new sanctification, and use them as the warp of a society..." (110).

"the Christian must conduct his business with a high seriousness, as in itself a kind of religion" (111).

"Such teaching... was admirably designed to liberate economic energies, and weld into a disciplined social force the
rising bourgeoisie...

Any one of the above quotes could be slipped into a new edition of *PE*, and only the most assiduous reader would notice
the addition. So what comes as a real surprise is that, when Tawney actually addresses Weber, he voices these complaints:

- "Weber seems to me to explain by reference to moral and intellectual influences developments which have their principal
explanation in another region altogether. There was plenty of 'capitalist spirit' in fifteenth-century Venice and
Florence..." (319).

- "But it seems a little artificial to talk as though capitalist enterprise could not appear till religious changes had produced
a capitalist spirit" (320).

Weber: "How is it to be explained historically that in Florence, the center of
capitalist development in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries and the marketplace for money and capital for all the great political powers, striving for profit was viewed as
either morally questionable or at best tolerated?" (96)

Here we see Weber noting that "capitalist enterprise" most certainly *did* appear before "religious changes had produced
a capitalist spirit," but that what that spirit changed was the *esteem* in which such enterprises were held.

- "[Weber] speaks as though all English Puritans in the seventeenth century held much the same view of social duties and
expediency" (320)

Weber: "Certainly, in the midst of these considerations, we should not forget the Puritanism
contained within itself a world of contradictions" (PE, 168).

- "Weber ignores, or at least touches upon to lightly, intellectual movements, which were favorable to the growth of
business enterprise and an individualist attitude towards economic relations, but which had little to do with
religion" (320).

Weber: "In turn, it must be recognize that these vantage points... by no means constitute the only ones possible in
reference to which the historical cases under consideration can be analyzed. Other vantage points would identify other
features of our historical cases as 'essential'..." (76-77).

In other words, Weber explicitly recognizes these "other vantage points" and is just choosing to focus on one in
particular.
