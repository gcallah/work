# The Protestant Hypothesis and the Spirit of Weber 

Gene Callahan

## Introduction

In his famous book, *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism*,
Max Weber famously explained the rise of capitalism by pointing to the Protestant ethic, which, he claimed, was an new
attitude towards work. A number of scholars have since disputed his explanation. This paper will examine the critiques,
and see if Weber can answer them..

But before we even look at Weber's thesis on the rise of capitalism, it will be helpful to visit his theory of ideal
types.


## Weber's Theory of Ideal Types


## Weber's Thesis

The puzzle to be explained: Protestants held more high positions in industry visa-a-visa Catholics, even in places where Catholics are the majority.

Explaining that puzzle will, Weber thinks, help us understand the origins of capitalism.

* What is the explanation for the Protestant-Catholic difference?

1. Historical circumstances: Wealthy towns wound up being Protestant.

2. Protestants were left freer, more indivualism.

	But Puritanism led to a much stricter control of life than did Catholicism!

Catholic higher education tended to be in the humanities.

Protestant training--technical and managerial.

Weber does not hold that these are permanent tendencies – over time, other groups come to follow the "logic" of the capitalist economy as well.

Catholics in the minority have not followed Jews, Chinese into business success. Protestants have been successful even in majority.

Common view of ideals of religions – Catholic is ascetic, Protestant is worldly.

	But this idea is contradicted by evidence- Pgs. 8-9

Pg. 11 -- the English: most pious and most commercial.

Pg. 13- the capitalist is an historical individual.

Pg. 14 – Weber is taking one standpoint amongst many.

Pg. 14-16- Franklin 

The duty of the industrialist is to increase his capital- this is an ethical maxim for Franklin.

Pg. 17- utility of virtue.

Pile up capital without enjoyment – sink into the grave under a great weight of goods!

A man diligent in business stands before kings.

Virtue and profession in a calling.

Duty in calling.

Pg. 19-20 -- In the present day, everyone must adapt to conditions.

Pg. 21 -- Franklin's spirit would have been condemned earlier.

Pg. 24 -- traditional amount of consumption.

Pg. 25 -- In the new attitude, labour is an end in itself.

Pg. 28 -- parvenus.

Pg. 29 -- life of the putter-out met traditional needs in a traditional manner.

Pg. 29-30 -- description of change.

Pg. 31 -- distrust of innovation.

Pg. 37 -- rational calculation became the basis of economic life.

Even Catholic capitalists thought their profession dangerous to salvation.

Give gifts to the Church to make up for making money.

Pg. 36- Marxist idea that ideas conform to the material base structure is nonsense here – much more materially developed
Florence and Venice were behind the backwoods of PA in regard to the development of capitalist attitudes.

Luther

A Calling -- vocation

--New Idea fulfilling one's worldly duties was the highest form of worldly activity.

The monastic life is a life of selfishness.

Labour in a calling expression of brotherly love.

But as Luther became more conservative, the calling came to be seen as accepting one's place in the current order.

Calvin

Calvinism is the strain of Protestantism that most promotes capitalism.

It is the combination of predestination – with worldly success as the sign of having been chosen -- and *disdain for consumption*
that leads to unlimited acquisition.


## The Critics

So what is Wrong with Weber's thesis, for those of rejected it completely or in part?


### Campbell

Noting that Weber's survey of Protestant thought essentially stops at around 1700, Campbell claims:

"This means that Weber's position must be taken to be one in which Protestantism as he outlined it constituted its
fully develop form, and that all that subsequently happened was a process of slow decline and decay in the face of the forces
of secularization and rationalization..." (165).

However, no, such thing "must be taken": all of that this shows is the Weber did not consider developments in
Protestantism after that time to be particularly relevant to his thesis. There simply is no implication that subsequent
developments were not important theologically or socially: Weber simply doesn't find them relevant for explaining the
*spirit of capitalism*.
