# The Protestant Hypothesis and the Spirit of Weber 

Gene Callahan

## Introduction

In his famous book, *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism*,
Max Weber famously explained the rise of capitalism by pointing to the Protestant ethic, which, he claimed, was an new
attitude towards work and accumulation. A number of scholars have since disputed his explanation.

I had taught Weber's book in several of my classes, and thus had read it several times, before encountering his critics.
When I did encounter them, I was stunned to find that many prominent criticisms of Weber's hypothesis had already been
answered in his book. In this introduction, I will offer just one salient example, so the reader can see kind of
problem I was discovering. Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson "reject" Weber's theory for the following reason:

"What about Max Weber’s Protestant ethic? Though it may be true that predominantly Protestant countries, such as the
Netherlands and England, were the first economic successes of the modern era, there is little relationship between
religion and economic success. France, a predominantly Catholic country, quickly mimicked the economic performance of
the Dutch and English in the nineteenth century, and Italy is as prosperous as any of these nations today. Looking
farther east, you’ll see that none of the economic successes of East Asia have anything to do with any form of Christian
religion, so there is not much support for a special relationship between Protestantism and economic success there,
either."

But in *The Protestant Ethic*, Weber very explicitly states that, once the "spirit of capitalism" was *birthed in
Protestant countries (for the reasons he explains), its material success would naturally result in its spreading to
non-Protestant areas. So he had, right in the work they are supposedly critiquing, already explained the facts that
Acemoglu and Robinson suppose refute him.

As I will illustrate, this is true of many other attempts to refute Weber's thesis. I certainly do not contend that
Weber's thesis is *irrefutable*, only that any attempt to refute it should at least pay careful attention to what he
actually said.

But before we even look at Weber's thesis on the rise of capitalism, it will be helpful to visit his theory of ideal
types, as, I contend, that is the setting in which *The Protestant Ethic* must be placed to be properly understood.


## Weber's Theory of Ideal Types


## Weber's Thesis

Weber begins his work with an observation that raises a question: in Germany at that time (1905), 
Protestants held more high positions in industry than Catholics, even in places where Catholics are in the majority.
Here, he is acting as a proper "social detective": given a curious situation, let us search for an explanation.
Furthermore, Weber suspects that solving this mystery might help us understand the origins of capitalism.

He begins by evaluating several popular explanations of this discrepancy.

1. Historical circumstances: Wealthy towns wound up being Protestant.

2. Protestants were left freer, more indivualism.

	But Puritanism led to a much stricter control of life than did Catholicism!

Catholic higher education tended to be in the humanities.

Protestant training--technical and managerial.

Weber does not hold that these are permanent tendencies – over time, other groups come to follow the "logic" of the capitalist economy as well.

Catholics in the minority have not followed Jews, Chinese into business success. Protestants have been successful even in majority.

Common view of ideals of religions – Catholic is ascetic, Protestant is worldly.

	But this idea is contradicted by evidence- Pgs. 8-9

Pg. 11 -- the English: most pious and most commercial.

Pg. 13- the capitalist is an historical individual.

Pg. 14 – Weber is taking one standpoint amongst many.

Pg. 14-16- Franklin 

The duty of the industrialist is to increase his capital- this is an ethical maxim for Franklin.

Pg. 17- utility of virtue.

Pile up capital without enjoyment – sink into the grave under a great weight of goods!

A man diligent in business stands before kings.

Virtue and profession in a calling.

Duty in calling.

Pg. 19-20 -- In the present day, everyone must adapt to conditions.

Pg. 21 -- Franklin's spirit would have been condemned earlier.

Pg. 24 -- traditional amount of consumption.

Pg. 25 -- In the new attitude, labour is an end in itself.

Pg. 28 -- parvenus.

Pg. 29 -- life of the putter-out met traditional needs in a traditional manner.

Pg. 29-30 -- description of change.

Pg. 31 -- distrust of innovation.

Pg. 37 -- rational calculation became the basis of economic life.

Even Catholic capitalists thought their profession dangerous to salvation.

Give gifts to the Church to make up for making money.

Pg. 36- Marxist idea that ideas conform to the material base structure is nonsense here – much more materially developed
Florence and Venice were behind the backwoods of PA in regard to the development of capitalist attitudes.

Luther

A Calling -- vocation

--New Idea fulfilling one's worldly duties was the highest form of worldly activity.

The monastic life is a life of selfishness.

Labour in a calling expression of brotherly love.

But as Luther became more conservative, the calling came to be seen as accepting one's place in the current order.

Calvin

Calvinism is the strain of Protestantism that most promotes capitalism.

It is the combination of predestination – with worldly success as the sign of having been chosen -- and *disdain for consumption*
that leads to unlimited acquisition.


## The Critics

So what is Wrong with Weber's thesis, for those who rejected it completely or in part? Given that this is a paper and
not a book, no attempt will be made here to do an exhaustive survey; hopefully, however, it will be a representative
one.


### Braudel

Fernand Braudel's (1977) criticisms of Weber are both brief and insubstantial. He first states that "For Max Weber,
capitalism in the modern sense of the word was no more and no less than the creation of Protestantism, or, to be even
more accurate, of Puritanism" (65-66).

One sees Braudel going wrong here right from the start: a more accurate summary might read, "For Max Weber, the *spirit*
of capitalism was given birth by Puritanism." The latter is clearly a more subtle thesis, and would be much harder
for Braudel to cavalierly dismiss, as he proceeds to do to his straw Weber:

"All historians have opposed this tenuous theory, although they have not managed to be rid of it once and for all. Yet it
is clearly false. The northern countries took over the place that earlier and so long and so brilliantly been occupied
by the old capitalist centers of the Mediterranean. They invented nothing, either in technology or in business
management." (66)

The problems here should, at this point, be obvious: Weber explicitly acknowledges the existence of large,
capital-intensive enteprises before the Protestant Reformation. And he made no claims about the northern countries
inventiveness. So although Braudel's assertion that the northern countries "invented nothing" seems absurd on
its face, it is will be neither necessary nor helpful to explore it here, since it has nothing to do with Weber's
thesis.

Braudel concludes his discussion of Weber by writing, "I believe Max Weber's error stems essentially from his
exaggeration of capitalism's role as promoter of the modern world" (67). It is hard to know what to make of this, for,
after all, Weber did not write a book called *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of the Modern World": he was exploring
the origin of capitalism, so naturally, his focus was on... capitalism. And this last claim does not even dovetail well
with Braudel's earlier one, which is that Weber simply got capitalism's origin story *wrong*: here it seems he just
placed too much emphasis on it!

### Campbell

Colin Campbell's under-appreciated *The Romantic Ethic and the Spirit of Modern Consumerism* is, in general,
complementary to Weber's book, in that Campbell largely accepts that Weber offers a good explanation for the origins of
the production side of ther modern economy; he sets out to do the same for the change that occurred in consumption.

Nevertheless, Campbell offers a minor criticism of Weber that is still worth addressing.
Noting that Weber's survey of Protestant thought essentially stops at around 1700, Campbell claims:

"This means that Weber's position must be taken to be one in which Protestantism as he outlined it constituted its
fully develop form, and that all that subsequently happened was a process of slow decline and decay in the face of the forces
of secularization and rationalization..." (165).

However, no, such thing "must be taken": all of that this shows is the Weber did not consider developments in
Protestantism after that time to be particularly relevant to his thesis. There simply is no implication that subsequent
developments were not important theologically or socially: Weber simply doesn't find them relevant for explaining the
*spirit of capitalism*.
